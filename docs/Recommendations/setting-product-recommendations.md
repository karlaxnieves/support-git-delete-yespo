Product recommendations increase the effectiveness of advertising communications. The system automatically selects relevant products for each situation and specific buyer according to established rules. Artificial intelligence algorithms will find products that your customers are most likely to want to buy.

To display recommended products, you can use the following:

* [Any site pages](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/recommendations-overview)
* [Mobile application](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/recommendations-in-mobile-app)
* [All Yespo media channels](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/recommendations-in-media-channels)

Before you start setting up recommendations:

1. [Install a web tracking script](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/how-set-web-tracking-your-website) or [set up tracking for mobile apps](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/streaming-events-firebase) to collect usersâ€™ online behavior data.
2. [Upload a product feed](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/importing-product-feed) to provide data about your product range.
3. [Create a data source for recommendations](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/create-data-source-recommendations): set filtering rules for different site pages, app and media channels.
4. [Configure additional recommendation filtering rules](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/custom-filters-recommendation-blocks): choose product parameters to be shown to specific categories of contacts (optional).

In this section you will also find general instructions for working with recommendations:

* [How to use analytics](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/recommendation-block-analytics)
* [How to conduct A/B testing](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/testing-recommendation-blocks)
