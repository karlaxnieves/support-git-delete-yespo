The data source is a recommendation filtering algorithm that can be applied to the website, media channels, and mobile application.

Creating a data source is mandatory when setting up any recommendation type in Yespo.

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> When setting up website recommendations in the Yespo admin panel, you can select the data source directly when configuring recommendations.

## Creating a Data Source in Account Settings

1\. Go to account settings:

      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/fe2035d46343c4c31e6dce875532676551f998523928a191d0f7b3d4806c7af0-e-7.webp",
        "",
        "Settings"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


2\. In the menu on the left, select the section _Data sources_ and click _New data source_ â†’ _Recommendations for messages or website_:

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


3\. Select a recommendation algorithm:

- Recommendations based on visitor data: The recommended products will be unique for each visitor. If the visitor is not authorized, bestsellers of all products will be displayed.

      ],
      "align": "center",

    }
  ]
}

      ],
      "align": "center",

    }
  ]
}
[/block]


In addition, you can add [custom filtering rules for the block](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/custom-filters-recommendation-blocks).

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> For email recommendations, use the following data sources:
> 
> - Abandoned cart (up to 6 products);
> - Recommendations for 6 abandoned products in the cart (up to 6 rec.);
> - Abandoned view (up to 6 products);
> - Recommendations for 6 abandoned views (up to 6 rec.);
> - Personal recommendations or bestsellers (up to 6 rec.) â€” for promo campaigns.
> 
> To find out which source is better to use for other triggered campaingÂ types, please contact our support team at [support@yespo.io](mailto:support@yespo.io)
