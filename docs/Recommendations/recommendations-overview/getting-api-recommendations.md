Receive product recommendations via API and use the resulting list of products to display them in recommendation blocks on your site.

To use the API recommendations:

1. Install the JavaScript API on your site.
2. [Upload a product data feed](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/importing-product-feed) to your Yespo account.
3. Request recommendations from the required pages using the JavaScript API.
4. After receiving an array of products, set up the display of blocks on your side (appearance, placements, headings).

## Connecting API Recommendations

1. Go to the _Site â†’ Recommendations_ tab and click the _New recommendation_ button.

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}

2. Select the _Product data for API_ usage option

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


3. Each type has different algorithms for product selections, for example, bestsellers for the main page or personalized recommendations for the category page. _Any page_ type is suitable for a wishlist, blog, promotions, etc.

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


4. Specify [data source](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/creating-a-data-source-for-recommendations).

        null,

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


5. The system will generate a JavaScript function:

- Copy it to your JavaScript.
- Call the function when you need to get product recommendations.
- Use product data in your response at your discretion.
- Set up [_ProductImpression_](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/how-set-web-tracking-sending-events-java-scipt-request#impressions) event transmission.

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


> ðŸ“˜ Important
> 
> In this recommendation type, the _ProductImpression_ event is not automatically sent. Pass it when site visitors actually view the recommendation block. As parameters in the request, you need to pass the product ID and _container\_type_, which were returned in the _getRecommendations_ response.

In the general list of recommendations, API recommendations will be marked with the corresponding icon.
