In Yespo, you can automatically add blocks with product recommendations to all available media channels in trigger and promo campaigns.

How to useÂ *Product blocks* inÂ email messages, read in this [article](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/using-the-products-block).

> ðŸ“˜ Note
>
> Before starting to configure recommendations:
>
> * [install web tracking script](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/web-tracking-overview) to collect usersâ€™ online behavior data
> * [upload a product feed](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/importing-product-feed) to provide data about your product range
> * [set up web tracking](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/how-set-web-tracking-your-website)
> * [create data sources](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/create-data-source-recommendations) for recommendation blocks

Available recommendation algorithms depend on the pricing plan.
