The recommendation blocks in the email are placed in stripes. Stripeâ€™s code contains the rules for substituting dynamic data.

You will find the _Abandoned browse_ template in your account, where this stripe is already set up.Â 

You only need to create data sources and insert their names into the stripesâ€™ code.

We will show how to create a trigger template with two dynamic stripes: one with products viewed by the user and one with recommendations based on products viewed. Each stripe requires its data source.

## Recommendation Setup Steps

1. Create [data sources](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/create-data-source-recommendations) based on the _Abandoned view (up to 6 products)_ and _Recommendations for 6 abandoned views (up to 6 rec.)_ algorithms.

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> Most algorithms are designed for specific advanced segmentation triggers and work only in them. Setting up a universal algorithm is described in the article [Setting Up Product Recommendations for Promo Campaigns](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/product-recommendations-promo).

2. Go to the _Messages_ section on the _Messages_ tab and click _New Email_.

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


3. Select the _Abandoned browse_ basic template.

        null,
        "Abandoned browse"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


The template contains 2 stripes with product cards:

- the first (_You recently viewed_) â€” with dynamic settings;
- the second (_You may also like_) is illustrative, without dynamic settings.

4. Select the first stripe with products and open its code.

[block:image]

  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/7020a855ac1dd63b48d57994fe2c3a164d4f2fce5fbc3bc1179ec49876ad63ba-recommendation_blocks_4.webp",
        null,
        "Stripe's code"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


5. In the **`#foreach($item in $data.get('views'))`** line, replace **`views`** with the name of the data source you created based on the _Abandoned view (up to 6 products)_ algorithm.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/4de78c9dc61f065bfe6eb4812402041a0a862e582df89dd3ab3ab7d871eea3e3-recommendation_blocks_5.webp",
        null,
        "Your source name"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


6. Customize the stripeâ€™s appearance.

The stripeâ€™s structure is universal: depending on the number of viewed items, the recipient will see one, two, or three cards in a row.

You can change the design of the stripeâ€™s elements: colors, text, and background.

We do not recommend changing the stripeâ€™s structure, i.e., the arrangement of its elements to each other: this will break the layout, and the recipient will see an incorrect display of the emailâ€™s content. Also, you cannot change the variables specified in the structure blocks since they are responsible for displaying product data from your feed.

If you want to create a fundamentally different structure with dynamic content, please send a request to [support@yespo.io](mailto:support@yespo.io)

[Learn more about designing recommendations in email](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/designing-recommendations-email).

7. Save the stripe as a module.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/e3c807b1c3fcedc824a78021b2a4946383edb022fed66533f4f515ee2d6e7459-recommendation_blocks_6.webp",
        null,
        "Save as a module"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


You can insert the saved moduleÂ in any campaigns with product selections, for example, for the _Abandoned cart_ trigger. You just need to replace the name of the data source.

We will use the saved module in the same template as a stripe with recommendations for viewed products.

8. Remove the illustrative stripe with product cards from the template (_You may also like_).

      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/4809517d3e77ee47a49a244bb976689d449c5f2dac589ea87fa134197ad87c88-recommendation_blocks_7.webp",
        null,
        "Delete stripe"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


9. Insert the module you saved before in place of the removed stripe.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/69049040b8c12c9de3e3ffbbb8f48c68a9e07616ef90c69a065f7f731e057fac-recommendation_blocks_8.webp",
        null,
        "Insert the module"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


10. Replace the name of the data source in the stripeâ€™s code with the one you created for the _Recommendations for 6 abandoned views (up to 6 rec.)_ algorithm.

This completes the recommendation settings. You can insert saved modules into your trigger template or redesign the template you are currently working on to match the style of your site.

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> You can define what to do with messages when there is no data for recommendations - to send or not. To do this, add one of the variants of the Velocity command to the recommendationsâ€™ code:
> 
> - **`$!datasource('source_name').required('false')`** â€” send,
> - **`$!datasource('source_name').required('true')` **â€” do not send.
