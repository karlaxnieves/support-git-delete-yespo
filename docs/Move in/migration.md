If you are on this page, it means you are interested in developing your marketing strategy using our platform. We would be glad to help you retain your customers and grow your business.

This guide will help you transfer your data and start your journey in Yespo if you have previously used a different marketing automation platform. It can also be a cheat sheet for those who have just decided to develop retention marketing with our system and do not know how to start.

## Step 1. Contact Base and Activity Transferring

You can import current users into Yespo as an `XLSX`, `XLS`, `CSV`, or `TXT` file ([manual](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/how-migrate-to-our-platform#manual-contact-import) or [through API](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/how-migrate-to-our-platform#contact-base-transfer-through-api)) and transfer [contact activity data](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/how-migrate-to-our-platform#contact-activity-transfer) in different ways. 

## Step 2. Communication Channels Transferring

Transfer the settings of the channels you used before to start omnichannel campaigns.

## Step 3. Workflow Transferring

Even a specialist without technical skills can set up automated notification sending with the handy chain builder. Use [ready-made workflows](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/how-migrate-to-our-platform#workflow-transfer) or create a new one.

## Step 4. Email Template Import

Import templates to Yespo as `HTML` code or as Stripo templates.

> Use [account roles](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/user-management) to speed up the migration process from another platform. While you're working with your contact base, your designer can transfer email templates at the same time.
