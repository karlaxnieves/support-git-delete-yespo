> ðŸ“˜ Note

> * You can invite a maximum of 5 users during the day.
> * The maximum number of users added to an organization is 20 (these can be users with different roles).
> * One email can be a log in for only one account. If the email is registered in another organization, it must be deleted from the previous one to transfer it to a new account.

## Blocking / Deleting a User

To block a user, click the lock icon in the user's line in the general list.

You can block a user permanently or temporarily, for example, during an employeeâ€™s vacation.

If the administrator blocks a user, access will be instantly closed, and the system will log out this user, even if they are currently working in the system. The administrator can remove all types of locks at any time.

To delete a user, click the ellipsis at the end of the line.

If you delete a user, you will not be able to restore it, but you will be able to create it again.
