Email marketing consists of different types of campaigns:

* Welcome
* Promo
* Triggered
* News
* Events, etc

However, too often communication can result in the negative outcome:

* Spam complaints
* Unsubscribes
* Decrease of loyalty

If you send frequent (daily) campaigns to different segments that can include the same contacts, there is a chance you might be too intrusive with part of your contact base. To avoid this, set up the annoyance level and limit messages you send.

> ðŸ“˜ Important
>
> Annoyance Level is applicable to emails and mobile push notifications. To manage the sending limit for all channels, set up [Campaign Frequency](https://yespo.io/blog/how-to-develop-effective-email-frequency-strategy) and [Subscription Categories](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/how-use-subscription-category).

1. Go to your personal profile â†’ *Settings* â†’ *Laboratory* and enable *Annoyance Level*.

2. Unroll the tab and specify daily and weekly annoyance limits.

The annoyance level consists of the daily and weekly limit credits you assign to a campaign depending on its type and sending frequency. Based on them, the system calculates the acceptable annoyance level for a particular contact using their contact ID. If the annoyance limit is exceeded for the contact, the campaign wonâ€™t be sent to them.

## Credit Calculation

The key with assigned daily limit credits resets every day at 00:00 UTC. The key with weekly credits resets on Sunday until 11:59 pm UTC.

## How to Assign Credits

**Email**

* In *Messages* â†’ *Messages* â†’Â *Email*, open the necessary email or create one.
* Click the subject to open its sender info settings.
* In *Annoyance level*, enter the necessary credit.

**Mob Push**

* In *Messages* â†’ *Messages* â†’ *Mob Push*, open the necessary pushÂ notificationÂ or create one.
* Enable *Annoyance level* and enter the necessary credit.

You can also set up the annoyance level in *Send options* when you schedule a campaign.

## Example of How to Use Annoyance Level

The online store sends several types of campaigns:

* Triggered promo. Sent to the segment that includes users who havenâ€™t visited the website for a week.
* Daily news.
* Weekly digest.

Annoyance credits for each type:

* Promo â€“ 3 credits;
* News â€“ 1 credit;
* Digest â€“ 2 credits.

**How the daily limit is calculated**

Say the daily annoyance limit is 4 credits. Contacts that have both email address and push token have one ID.

Today, the user has already received a promo email and news push and thus reached the limit. A digest won't be sent to this user.

**How the weekly limit is calculated**

Say that the weekly annoyance limit is 10 credits.

If today is Thursday, and the user has already received several messages and reached 8 credits, till the end of the week they can receive either one message assigned with 2 credits or two messages assigned with 1 credit each.

The system wonâ€™t send campaigns to contacts with exceeded limits. Such messages will fall to *Errors*.

> ðŸ“˜ Important

> Assign important messages with 0 annoyance level so that their send does not affect the limit. But if the daily or weekly level is already exceeded, campaigns with even 0 annoyance level wonâ€™t be sent anyway.
