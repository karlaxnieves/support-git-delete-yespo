## Can I Top Up My Balance and Start Campaigns Immediately?

The algorithm for starting the system depends on what functionality you plan to use.

If you want to start with promo campaigns, first [verify the domain](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/how-set-email-domain-authentication). After this, you can send out campaigns even without topping up your account â€” 2,500 free emails are available.

If you activate CDP features, you need to make some additional settings. Please contact us for advice and support in connecting **Extra features**.

To make omnichannel campaigns, prepare the following settings:

* **SMS** â€“ register an SMS sender ID or [enable processing](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/setting-up-sms-processing).
* **Viber** â€“ [add sender ID](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/how-add-sender-name-viber).
* **Web Push** â€“ [follow the instructions on the link](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/web-push).
* **Mobile Push** â€“ [integrate your mobile app with Yespo](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/mobile-push).
* **App Inbox** â€“ set up a channel for a [website](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/how-to-set-up-integration-for-app-inbox) and/or [mobile app](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/app-inbox-for-mobile-apps).
* **Web Widget**Â â€“Â installÂ scriptÂ onÂ website andÂ [setting up widgets](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/setting-up-widgets-for-your-site).
* **In-App**Â â€“Â [connect your mobile app to Yespo](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/connecting-mobile-apps) and [install SDK](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/in-app#step-2-install-sdk).
* **Telegram**Â â€“ integrating with [Telegram Bot](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/integrating-telegram-bot).

After completing the settings, connect the appropriate channels on the **Pricing plans** tab.

## How to Top Up My Account in the System?

Click the **Add funds** button on the main account page. When replenishing via built-in systems, funds are credited automatically.

When paying by bank transfer, funds are received in the system within 3-4 hours; if there are delays on the bankâ€™s side, the payment may take 1-3 days. If you have an urgent campaign planned, send us a scan/photo of the receipt to [sales@yespo.io](mailto:sales@yespo.io).

## What Payment Methods are in the System?

The system has several payment methods:

* Visa/Mastercard payment cards.
* Payment by legal entities and individuals with an invoice.
* Paypal.

To add a card, click the **Pricing plans** button on the main account page, go to the **Payment methods** tab, and click **Add card**.
