Contact Import is a feature that enables quick creation of a contact list for [SMS](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/creation-sms) or Email campaigns. It’s often used for manual mapping of the contact base from the internal CRM to the Reteno.

## 1. File Preparation

Contact List is a file with all the information about clients organized in rows and columns. The file formats that are supported for import are: xlsx, xls, csv, and txt. [Details>](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/files-preparation)

## 2. Field Mapping

After you’ve downloaded the file, you need to map the columns from your file to the corresponding fields in the system. This will allow using these data for more targeted personalization and segment creation. [Details>](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/file-uploading#mapping-contact-fields)

## 3. Import Parameters Settings

At this stage, you’ll have to choose list segments and restore the deleted contacts. [Details>](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/file-uploading#import-parameters)
