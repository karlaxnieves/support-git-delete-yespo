The contact profiles keep all the records of each contact in our system. These records include:

- The data collected from the contactâ€™s activities, such as interactions with your website, mobile application, campaigns, orders, and others.

In the contact profile, you can do the following:

- View and edit the profile details.
- View the contact activity.

Edit the contactâ€™s subscription and assign additional fields. Read this [article](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/how-add-additional-contact-fields) to learn more about additional fields.
