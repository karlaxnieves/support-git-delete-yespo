**1. I have a legally collected validated contact base. How come there are blacklisted contacts in it?**

After an import, you may find some of the imported contacts blacklisted. It happens because the system checks emails on its own general blacklist. If contact is blacklisted, it means it has already been used for some campaigns, and the system defined it as invalid. Blacklisted contacts arenâ€™t included in workflows and have no impact on your reputation as a sender.

**2. How do I download the phone number database?**

The Phone Number field is a standard field that can contain only integer numbers; no text or special characters are supported.

The contacts from this field are used to send SMS and Viber messages. The number should be specified in the international format:
*380955547708
447911123456
0207183 8750
1229501112325*

See more detailed requirements for contact fields.

**3. Can I buy a contact list from you and use it for my campaigns?**

No.
If you care about your reputation, never use bought lists. Otherwise, you risk facing bans by email clients, problems with an ESP, fines, poor response rate and loss of credibility.
