Subscription categories allow companies to manage campaigns and send them to particular contact segments. You can create unlimited subscription categories, for example:

- Newsletters;
- Product categories;
- Promo and sales;
- Subscriptions to products of a particular brand.

Contacts will be included in categories based on their preferences and will receive only campaigns they are interested in.

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> Subscription categories arenâ€™t a default feature. You need to create them manually.

      ],
      "align": "center",

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


andÂ a segment with the same name that will appear in the general list of segments.Â The correspondingÂ label marks each segment assigned to the category.

## Adding Contacts to the Category

You can add contacts to the category in the following ways:

- Importing new contacts;
- Exporting existing contacts;
- Transferring contacts from the subscription form or CRM [via API](https://docs.yespo.io/reference/getting-started-with-your-api).

The same contacts added to one category via different methods are not duplicated.

### Importing New Contacts

1\. Choose the necessary subscription category and click _Import contacts_.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/c91ecadd1750056c293c444b8e48a54cdb8a3d7faa7269d77a70b2996651a232-caregoty-en-006.webp",
        "",
        "Import contacts"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


2\. Youâ€™ll be directed to [_New import_](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/file-uploading). Upload the file with contacts and map contact fields.

        "",
        "New import"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


3\. The assigned segment will be specified automatically.

4\. Once the import is successfully completed, contacts will appear in the category.

### Exporting Existing Contacts

You can export to the category existing single contacts or list segments.

1. To export a single contact:

- Go to _segment_, click _Add contact_ and select _Add from existing_.

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


To remove a category from a contact card, go to it and click _Edit contact_.

[block:image]

  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/4293f4bbbcff4b8f7df0319713ba200b93d9360ef23978f3fb46a92560ccb854-caregoty-en-015.webp",

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]

        "https://files.readme.io/79089ecfe71e7b0935d41ea4f9bb3b02e3c87208490ea4d848177bd6eb4e697a-caregoty-en-016.gif",
        "",
        "Edit contact subscription"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


Contacts that are excluded from the category remain in the account and will be available for other campaigns. The category itself is not deleted.

## Setting Up Unsubscription

You can set up unsubscription from all campaigns or from a certain category. A contact can unsubscribe:

- In the personal account on the site;
- In the email;
- On the unsubscribe page.

Subscription categories can be displayed on the unsubscribe page so that users can update their preferences on their own. To set up such a page, send a request to our support team.

## Creating Category-Based Campaign

You can use subscription categories to control the frequency of campaigns depending on their subscriberâ€™s interests. Subscription categories apply to all communication channels. Subscription categories are specified when the message is created.

- In _Messages â†’ Messages_, create a message or choose the existing one.
- Open its general settings, click _Select categories_, and select categories applicable to the message. You can select several categories. Below is an example of choosing categories for email.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/15e5d733c381d912ac7859ad094f1593c3b0d28bf7ac37b9d8b6e83eb992f1cf-caregoty-en-017.webp",
        "",
        "Select categories"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


When scheduling the campaign, you can select any other segments to send it.Â 

The system will automatically calculate the contacts following the rules:

- The message is sent only to contacts from the selected segments who have subscribed to the corresponding subscription category.
- If the message isnâ€™t assigned to any category, it will be sent to all contacts from selected segments.

[A campaign report](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/campaigns-analytics) will show the subscription categories applied to the message.
