Using multilingual workflows, you can send one message that dynamically displays different language versions to your subscribers.

> ðŸ“˜ Important
> 
> The system automatically determines the language for a campaign based on one of the algorithms:
> 
> 1. If the event doesnâ€™t determine the language, the message will be sent in the language specified in theÂ [contact profile](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/user-profile). This is convenient for the existing base.
> 2. If the event determines the language, the message will be sent in this language. The language specified in the user profile will be ignored.
> 3. If the language isnâ€™t determined by the event and isnâ€™t specified in the user profile, the message will be sent in the default language.

## Creating Bulk Campaign

The process of scheduling/launching a bulk multilingual campaign is standard:

- select a multilingual message,
- move toÂ _Campaigns_,
- select aÂ [segment](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/segmentation),
- schedule or send a message.

The system will automatically send the necessary content to the corresponding contact. You don't need to build segments based on the language.

## Creating Triggered Workflow

The language value is passed from the event to the workflow's message block to theÂ _languageParam_Â (_Set the language parameter for the workflow_) field. This field is available in theÂ [Email block](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/message-blocks), and allÂ _Send obligatory (transactional) messages_Â tasksÂ ([email](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/popular-blocks#send-obligatory-transactional-email), [SMS](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/popular-blocks#send-transactional-sms-message), [Viber](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/popular-blocks#send-transactional-viber-message)).

Place any of these blocks in the workflow and

- Copy the name of the variable responsible for the language code from the event you link to the workflow.
- Wrap the variable in a dollar sign and curly braces in the _languageParam_ field of the workflow block.

If you use one of the [single message blocks](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/message-blocks) except for email, there is no _languageParam_ field. This means the message will be sent in the language specified in the user profile. The message will be sent in the default language if the language isnâ€™t specified in the user profile. If you need to determine language by the event, use the _Condition_ workflow blocks.

## Using Workflow Condition Blocks for Multilingual Campaigns

1. Create separate messages for every language you want to use.
2. Add the _Condition_ blocks with such settings to the workflow:

- Task name â€” _Variable matches regular expression_,
- name â€” variable name (eg, _Language_),
- pattern â€” regular language code value checked for compliance.

  "images": [

      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/caf717fbde4c0bcd3e3c61b5a60d187ca066b268609ca42c1aeaa9a1f0e3b919-creating-multilingual-campaigns-02.webp",
        "",
        "Condition's settings"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


Each _Condition_ block should check if the event variable matches the specified pattern.

- If it does â€” the workflow goes by Yes brunch, which should be connected with the message in the corresponding language;
- If it doesn't â€” the workflow goes by No brunch, which should be connected with the following condition block.

The last _Condition_ block should be connected with the message on the default language by both branches. This way, if the event variable doesnâ€™t match any specified pattern, such users will receive this last message.
