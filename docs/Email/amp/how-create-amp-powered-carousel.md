## How to Create an AMP-Powered HTML Carousel

1. Go to _Messages_ and choose any template you want to edit. Go to _Blocks → AMP-Carousel_.

    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/39d233a830aeb8689681469fb9fcbef7b1e5c618f6b0e8291e6e43f7f861814b-AMP-Carousel.gif",
        "Blocks > AMP-Carousel in the system",
        "Blocks → AMP-Carousel in the system"
      ],
      "align": "center"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


2. Drag an AMP-carousel block to the HTML block you’re editing.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/fdaaa2dab3138648732ab427557d52d85395260fd98caa7d041594293d975546-amp2.gif",
        "Drag an AMP-carousel block to the HTML block",
        "Drag an AMP-carousel block to the HTML block"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


This block is “⚡HTML” tagged by default, as an AMP element is displayed only in email clients that support the AMP technology (Gmail, Mail.ru as for now). In other email clients, this block will be hidden: below there is provided an alternative option for such emails.

3. Double-click on the block to start editing.

- To add a slide, you can download **the images** from your computer, use the prepared images or bank images, or insert an external link to an image. One image shouldn’t be more than 2MB. The number of slides is unlimited.

    }
  ]
}
[/block]


- Set the preview width, if needed, and add alternate text.

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "40% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


- Enable _Display preview_ and click on _Message view_ to see how your carousel will be displayed in an email on different devices.

    }
  ]
}
[/block]


> 📘 Important
> 
> Use images of the same height for smooth slide switching.

If the uploaded images are of different sizes, you can edit them in a built-in image editor. On the left of the slide image, click on _Edit image → Crop_, and set the necessary parameters.

## How to Create an HTML Block for Email Clients that Don’t Support AMP

AMP-supported blocks will be displayed only for Gmail users. To make it visible in other email clients (Apple and Yahoo! Mail as for now), **create a dynamic carousel** using <a rel="nofollow" href="http://freshinbox.com/resources/tools/carousel/" target="_blank"> FreshInbox</a>.

- Go to Freshinbox and add necessary images by inserting their URL. The carousel should contain not less than three images.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/ca1a193656141e957a3b2e35a898178b0530154043d66cff15a984357be808a9-how-to-create-dynamic-carousel.webp",
        "How to create a dynamic carousel using FreshInbox",
        "How to create a dynamic carousel using FreshInbox"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


- If needed, add extra images by clicking on _More images_.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/2bd9b74ed310f1cffe3bbc85d7347bba5f73d3f9fed7470a5eadc6a4c340be30-how-to-add-more-images.webp",
        "How to add more images",
        "How to add more images"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


- Edit the image parameters. For carousel blocks, responsiveness is set by default.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/f555edf8ef914a2a05756e94ed10a56d3d651b3512b799850b18e846b173b99e-how-to-edit-images.webp",
        "How to edit images",
        "How to edit images"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


- Test the carousel by sending it to your email address.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/d789a79cbc09eed4eb1dd413bf3987052cb4a3a7d8088951c80d582310b4c13f-test-the-carousel.webp",
        "Test the carousel by sending it to your email address",
        "Test the carousel by sending it to your email address"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


Now you need to **transfer the carousel block**.

- Drag an HTML block to the previously created email with the AMP-powered carousel, and click on it to open the code editor tab.

[block:image]

    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/314471079cc7953613520546b63333c4994be176bc3782b73743a808461b2b7e-amp11.gif",
        "Transfer the carousel block",
        "Transfer the carousel block"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


- Click on the added carousel, go to _Include in_ and click on _HTML_.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/4436cb20cd4427ae2266f91bc5710fadb0ac18b4cad7157c742fb919a397098c-amp17.webp",

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


- Click on _Message view_ to see how both blocks look on different devices.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/3ea353b004bfa0b585799d113f15597f70f1fe76595a694530c2b2ef2ce51271-look-on-different-devices.gif",

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


> 📘 Important
> 
> - When you enable _Include in HTML_, the selected element will be displayed in all email clients that support only classic HTML-mime protocol.
> - When you enable _Include in AMPHTML_ (⚡HTML), the selected element will be displayed in all email clients that support AMPHTML-mime protocol (text-x-amphtml).
> - If you enable _Include in both_ (set by default), the selected element will be displayed in all email clients.
> - If the email client doesn't support the format of the selected element, the recipient will only see the first image.

**A few more tips:**

- Instead of an interactive HTML carousel, you can add a regular product card and enable _Include in HTML_. It will be displayed only in those clients that don’t support the AMP technology.

- You can edit carousel images in the built-in image editor:

\- add text;  
\- edit size;  
\- add a button, etc.
