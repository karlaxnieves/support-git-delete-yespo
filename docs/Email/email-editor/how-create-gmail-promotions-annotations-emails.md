## Annotations Best Practices by Gmail

The higher the image quality and the more relevant the offer, the higher the chance that your campaign will be highlighted at the top of the _Promotions_ tab. Take a look at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://developers.google.com/gmail/promotab/best-practices" target="_blank">annotation best practices by Gmail</a>.

**Test**

Create a special Gmail account for testing, ending in `promotabtesting@gmail.com`, for example `mycompany.promotabtesting@gmail.com` This account will simplify and speed up the testing process. Gmail also enables beta features for these testing accounts before the public release.

**Avoid image reusing**

Avoid using the same banner so that users donâ€™t disregard it as a duplicate.

The same applies to the subject, discount code, badge, and expiration date: avoid repeating the information in these elements.

Add the discount code only if it is used in the email.

**Watch the image size**

Stick to the recommended sizes to make the offer look attractive on the general list.
