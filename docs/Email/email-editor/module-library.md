A module is a structural element of a template that can be used in many emails, for example, header, product card, banner, footer, etc.

The email editor contains a built-in library of modules, which is located in the _Content_ tab on the left and is divided into two tabs:

- _My modules_ â€” saved in your account modules,
- _Advanced_ â€” ready-to-use standard modules.

Use modules so you donâ€™t have to create or copy similar elements from previous emails each time, but simply drag them into the template.

## Creating Your Module

1. Open your email or create a new one (the _Messages â†’ Messages_ section).

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/76d064eb21f12839974185e6361700a5b5366187bb19dbaba61af4d27c4b2dae-modules-2.webp",

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


2. Select the element, and click on the three dots on the right if it is a structure or stripe and on the left if it is a container.

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


3. Click the _Save as module_ icon, after which you need to enter the module settings in the left panel.

      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/c7c6c7427f051862e46b97fe4057918531b7e86e073a2efc14c58bfa62d107d0-modules-4.webp",

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


## Module Settings

Do the following in the left panel:

1. Enter the module name for a quick search.
2. Add a description (optional) to clarify information about the specifics of its use.
3. Select a category so that the settings on the [_Appearance_](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/designing-your-email) tab are applied according to the element type (optional).
4. Activate the _Synchronized_ switch if you want the module to be automatically updated in other emails ([more about synchronized modules](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/how-create-synchronized-module-support)).
5. Add [tags](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/how-add-tags) for easy searching.
6. The ID is generated automatically for use in emails with dynamic variables, but you can change it to make the ID meaningful.
7. Save the module.

## Module Displaying

Modules are displayed in the library as a list or as a tile. They are divided into categories selected when saving. When you hover your cursor over the module, a preview with more detailed information will appear on the right:

- module image,
- name,
- description,
- tags,
- type,
- identifier (if it was not changed when saving, it corresponds to the structural type of the module).

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/33646d9a0948635efa3f8c836028b2872fd2f2b0f9a06ecd97dc7884212f0c8a-modules-6.webp",

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


## Editing Module Parameters

1. Go to the modules section.
2. Hover over the desired module.
3. Click the three dots and select _Edit_.
4. Make changes.
5. Update the module or save it as new.

        "https://files.readme.io/01a07b7636291ed26413b5bf1d30cf676580c25804158125c1420fd175636011-modules-8.webp",

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


## Searching and Grouping Modules

**1. Searching by name or tag.** Enter the name, part of the name, or a tag in the #tag format in the search bar if you gave tags to the modules. Press _Enter_.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/27590ad487ba0abd1f8281ce6a1e1ab9fd635e0223718bf393713921cb4051c3-modules-9.webp",
        "Searching by name or tag",
        "Searching by name or tag"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


**2. Grouping by categories.** Click on the filter icon. In the _Group by_ item, select _Ð¡ategory_ and then select categories to filter in the list. By default, all are checked. You can remove unnecessary ones by unchecking them or clear everything by clicking the corresponding button. You can check the boxes manually or select all using the button.

[block:image]

  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/6fee3c70d2c48d3e9fbb551560838af6ad463971ca5ef5f0cec424465e0b299a-modules-10.webp",
        "Grouping by categories",
        "Grouping by categories"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


**3. Grouping by tags.** Select _Tag_ under _Group by_. Modules grouped by tags will appear in the list or tile.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/75449e1bc4a3401af8c386b43b49e9c0a9b19df2ac4ea3bedcc24807ea92030a-modules-11.webp",
        "Grouping by categories",
        "Grouping by categories"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


Modules with the same tags are collected under one label. If there are several tags, but not all of them match, the module will be displayed separately under the tags, separated by commas. Modules without labels are located in the _Other_ section.

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> Remember to clear the filter and search bar; otherwise, you will see modules according to the last applied filter results.

## Using Advanced Modules

Using modules from the library significantly reduces layout time. If you have not yet created your modules, are not experienced enough in working with the editor, or need to create an email urgently, use advanced modules. The _Advanced_ tab has over 300 ready-made modules to add to your message.  
By default, modules are placed in the order in which they are most often used in an email:

- Preheaders
- Headers
- Banners
- Info Modules
- Product Cards
- Footers
- AMP Sandbox

Each category features several modules and a button to download more. The identifier in the preview will show the moduleâ€™s structural type when hovering over it: stripe, structure, or container.

        "https://files.readme.io/70ba10e1c69e72081a9ebb31cc2ab7a9261640dfcb4e2f58718e76448c7c1ba9-modules-12.webp",

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


You can find an advanced module using a filter or search, like a saved one. However, the saved modules do not have tags, so they are combined into the _Other_ category.

Please note: the names of common modules are indicated in Latin.

To add a module to an email, drag it to the desired location in the editor. Now, you can edit the content and add it to your library.
