Using images in marketing messages enhances their effectiveness by making them more attractive, informative, and emotionally charged. Let's look at how to work with the _Image_ block in the Yespo email editor.

## Adding Image to Email

1. Open your email or create a new one (the _Messages â†’ Messages_ section).

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/e83956332379f21051ceeb005f680921c2156ce91e92b0763a312023dfcd0a90-1-3.webp",
        "Messages â†’ Messages",
        "Messages â†’ Messages"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


2. Drag the _Image_ block into the template.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/caee11bef2793d7c31e13156f811d0f963931ae71b1fd7ed7cf3f2d7d7ca9c0b-1-10.webp",
        "Drag the image",
        "Drag the image"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


You can also drag a structure into the template and click on its image icon.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/2a2723d63e69a96deab7aee5d7b17a9f857d5cb9e851233af52467114be50f46-1-8.webp",
        "Drag a structure",
        "Drag a structure"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


The menu for uploading an image will open on the left.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/0774ddb42d8a1f26a1d9e1295f2a4e6dc78a867b673b921ac3a682dc45d0e97e-1-4.webp",
        "Uploading an image",
        "Uploading an image"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


Choose from four ways to add an image:

1. Upload the prepared image from your PC.
2. Select from common images. In this section, you can add images for repeated use, for example, a logo or photo of the manager.
3. Select from system images. Standardized images are collected here, for example, social network icons, CTA images for downloading apps in the official App Store and Google Play stores, etc.
4. Select from the bank. Here are ready-to-use images from `pexels.com` and `pixabay.com` and icons from IconFinder.com.

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> The _Common_ folder stores pictures that are available in all messages. The _Prepared_ folder contains only images used in a specific email.

### Downloading from PC

On the _Prepared_ tab, click the download icon and select the desired file on your PC. The system supports images in PNG, JPG, and GIF formats. For pictures to load quickly in the newsletter, their weight should not exceed 3 MB.

  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/30f6b548f4943cce474c3190f450300b6865bbe513f9239cea09a3625baf897e-1-15.webp",

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


### External Link

Enter a link to an open source in the appropriate field.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/bcfc655ac2c24e22afd83e2e733b49f4e49eab38c39c26fba3b33511ee3ff9ea-1-13.webp",
        "External link",
        "External link"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


Downloading from an external source significantly saves time. The disadvantage of this method is that the image may no longer be displayed due to it being moved or deleted on the site. If this may happen, please upload the image to the gallery.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/0bfe0ca7302aa3ef867730fc6650224e8f94b9e86c119eeb8754bfa3dbca2fe4-1-1.webp",
        "Download to the gallery",
        "Download to the gallery"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


### Image Bank

Go to the _Bank_ tab, select _Images_ or _Icons_ and enter a keyword into the search engine, then choose the image that best matches the intent of your campaign.

        "Image Bank",
        "Image Bank"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


### Editing Image

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


You can apply one of 18 built-in filters or several at once to an image.

    }
  ]
}
[/block]


You can also change the radius of the corners, set the background of the canvas, and combine objects (stickers, drawings, etc.) with the image.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [

        "Editing image",
        "Editing image"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
