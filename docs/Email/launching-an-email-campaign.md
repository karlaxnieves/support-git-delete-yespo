After completing the [email channel's basic settings](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/email-setting-up), you can start preparing the campaign.

See detailed instructions on [creating an email message](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/compose-email) and [sending a campaign](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/how-launch-email-campaign) in the linked articles.

We also recommend that you read the guides that will help improve the results of the campaign:

- [How to add a hidden preheader](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/adding-a-hidden-preheader) to boost the open rate
- [How to test subject lines](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/how-test-email-subject-lines) and find the best converting one
- [How to engage contacts with extra campaigns](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/how-send-extra-campaign) based on their response to the message (the feature available for all communication channels in Yespo)

> ðŸ“˜ Recommendation
> 
> Use [purchase possibility segmentation](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/segmentation-web-tracking-events#3-predicted-event) when you want to reduce the cost of your messaging without losing the potential revenue it should generate. By leaving only the most likely buyers in the target segment, you will reduce the number of messages sent, but at the same time retain as many possible orders as possible.
