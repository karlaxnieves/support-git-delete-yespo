The report on triggered email is similar to the bulk one. Let's consider a few differences between bulk and triggered reports.
## General Information
The top part of the report contains the following data:
  * Name of the email.
  * Start button for first-time launching.
  * Stop button for an active campaign.
  * Subject line.
  * Tags: allow to find and filter emails quickly.
  * [Sender name](https://docs.reteno.com/docs/adding-a-sender-name).
  * [Annoyance level](https://docs.reteno.com/docs/annoyance-level) (optional);
  * Email preview.

## Email Statistics
You can view statistics on the sent triggered campaigns for any period. Select it in the right upper corner of the screen from the dropdown menu.

**You can select such options:**
  * today,
  * 7 days — last week (including today),
  * 28 days — the previous 4 weeks,
  * current month,
  * previous month,
  * all the time — since the start of the workflow and the first sending of this message,
  * period — you can specify the dates yourself.

Click on any of these options, and the system will display a report for the selected period.

## Email Performance

### Activity dynamics

This graph is based on the selected period, where you can see the number of:
  * delivered, opened, clicked, and reported as spam emails;
  * unsubscribed users.
