The Reteno system starts collecting data right after the [campaign has been sent](https://docs.reteno.com/docs/sending-email-messages). 

General Campaign Report
-----------------------

All the collected data on all campaigns are stored in _Campaigns_ > _Reports_. The general report contains two sections:

- [Bulk](https://docs.reteno.com/docs/bulk-email-reports) (manual)
- [Triggered](https://docs.reteno.com/docs/triggered-email-reports) (automated)  
  To see the detailed results for a particular campaign, click on its name in the list.

Single reports
--------------

On _Single report_ tab in the _Campaigns section_, you can monitor single messages sent from a workflow or as a test message from the editor.

        "image2.png"
      ],
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]

</p>

Here you will see a list of messages sorted by the time they were sent. To find a specific message, use the search bar and enter the recipient's contact ID, label, or message title. As in the general reports tab, you can specify the period to display.
