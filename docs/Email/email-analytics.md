The Reteno system starts collecting data right after the [campaign has been sent](https://docs.reteno.com/docs/sending-email-messages). 

## General Campaign Report

All the collected data on all campaigns are stored in *Campaigns* > *Reports*. The general report contains two sections:

* [Bulk](https://docs.reteno.com/docs/bulk-email-reports) (manual)
* [Triggered](https://docs.reteno.com/docs/triggered-email-reports) (automated)\
  To see the detailed results for a particular campaign, click on its name in the list.

## Single reports

On *Single report* tab in the *Campaigns section*, you can monitor single messages sent from a workflow or as a test message from the editor.

Here you will see a list of messages sorted by the time they were sent. To find a specific message, use the search bar and enter the recipient's contact ID, label, or message title. As in the general reports tab, you can specify the period to display.
