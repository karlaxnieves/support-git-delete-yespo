Product blocks allow you to add personalized recommendations for each email subscriber without using code.

Before working with the blocks, you need to:

1. Connect one of the [advanced features](https://yespo.io/segmentation-price) pricing plans
2. Set up [web tracking](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/web-tracking-overview)
3. Create [a data source for recommendations](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/create-data-source-recommendations)

After this, you can customize the display of bestsellers or recommendations based on user data. Product recommendations are a powerful tool for personalizing campaigns, informing the audience about the product range, and increasing conversion rates
