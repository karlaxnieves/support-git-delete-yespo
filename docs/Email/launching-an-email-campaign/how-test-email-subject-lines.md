You can conduct split testing of a campaign subject line in 2 ways:

- Set multiple subjects in your email
- Split the audience into several segments and send emails with different subjects to each segment

## Experiment with Subjects in Email

Specify the email's subject and click _Add subject_ in the email editor; enter an alternative one. You can use any number of alternative subjects.

        "Add subject",

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


When sending, the system will divide recipients into equal parts according to the number of email subjects.

### Evaluating Test Results

1. In the _Campaigns â†’ Reports_ section, open the report on the campaign with the experiment with subjects. See subject performance metrics on the _Experiments_ tab.

        "Experiments",
        "Experiments"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}

The larger the segment, the more reliable the test result.

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> [Google Analytics](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/tracking-effectiveness-mailing-google-analytics) will collect statistics within one campaign without details by subjects. If you need to determine how many sales a particular subject made, use testing with a segmentâ€™s splitting.

## Testing Subjects with Target Segmentâ€™s Splitting

1. Go to a segment to which you want to send a campaign (_Contacts â†’ Segments_).
2. Click _Split segment_.

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


3. Set the segment partsâ€™ number and the percentage split. The maximum number of parts is 3. Activating the _Distribute evenly_ switch ensures that segments contain equal contact numbers.

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


New segments will appear in the segmentsâ€™ list after splitting:

        "New segments",

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


4. Create several emails (corresponding to the number of segmentâ€™s parts) with the same content but different subjects. Give messages different names to analyze the results of the campaign in GA.
5. Send emails to prepared segments.
