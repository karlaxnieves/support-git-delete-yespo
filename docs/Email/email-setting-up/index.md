Before you start your first campaign, make sure to make some technical settings:

## Step 1. Setting Up MX, SPF, DKIM, and DMARC Records

These records are necessary to ensure 100% deliverability of your campaigns and form your domain reputation for the email services. [This step-by-step guide](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/dns-record-change) will help you with settings.

## Step 2. Adding sender names

Use your company domain name as a corporate address and add different prefixes before @ sign for different campaign types. For example, `promo@yourdomain.com`,  `sales@yourdomain.com`, `ceo@yourdomain.com`, etc. [Details >](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/how-add-or-change-sender-name)

## Step 3. Warming Up Domain

Gradually increase the number of emails sent from your new domain. The better you [warm up the domain](https://yespo.io/blog/first-campaigns-new-domain-how-warm-right), the faster and for a greater number of users you'll be able to launch the campaign.

## Step 4. Add a favicon (*optional*)

[Favicon](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/adding-favicon-emails-web-version) is a small image associated with your brand, which you can add to your emails’ web version.
