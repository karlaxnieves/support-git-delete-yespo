Favicon is a small image associated with your brand.

Most typically, we can see favicons in the web browser's address bar; they are also used in emails’ web versions. Well-designed icons combined with your website logo will help users quickly identify your brand.

All our users have the Yespo favicon added by default, but you can replace it.

## How to Add Custom Favicon to the Email’s Web Version

1. Go to your account settings → *Laboratory* tab.
2. Click the *Upload favicon* button in the *Favicon* section. Upload image in .ico format, 16x16 pixels.

Once downloaded, the image will appear in your emails' web versions.

## Things to Remember

1. You can upload only one icon at a time.
2. With each new upload, old icons are overwritten. Only the last added icon is considered relevant.
3. Your favicon will be added to all emails generated after its upload. Re-save an email after favicon uploading to pull a new favicon.
4. Sometimes, a favicon is displayed in the browser tab with a delay. In that case:

* clean cache in browser settings
* or open the web version of a new email in the browser where you didn’t open it before the favicon was changed.
