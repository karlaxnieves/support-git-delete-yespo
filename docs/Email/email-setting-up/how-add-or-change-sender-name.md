### Dynamic Sender Address

Use this option to send a bulk campaign with different senders. For example, when you need to automatically substitute the names of a personal manager for each customer. For triggered messages sent through a workflow, you can use as a reply-to address:

- Event parameter value
- Contact field data

To add a dynamic sender address, follow the next steps in the email editor.

1. Click on _Sender_.

To substitute the sender from the contact card, click on the person icon  and select the appropriate contact field. The variable will be automatically added to the field.
