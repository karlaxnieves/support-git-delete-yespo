Use the following blocks in the Yespo editor as additional components of the [Products](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/using-the-products-block) block:

- **Price** â€” synchronizes the price with the website, allowing you to distinguish between the current price and the old one.
- **Discount** â€” clearly shows the benefit to the user in percentage.

Using these blocks together makes the offer more attractive, as subscribers can immediately see the benefit and the amount of savings.

> ðŸ“˜ Important
> 
> The PriceÂ and DiscountÂ blocks are available when you have at least one [order](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/orders-1) in your account.

## Blocks Configuration

Drag the blocks to the pre-created product card and click on those you want to edit â€” a settings panel will open on the left.

    }
  ]
}
[/block]


### Price Block

You can change the following settings in the block:

#### Show old price

This is the default option. Deactivate the slider to display only the current price.

      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/a6df132154c2cd1668903fb6da1bece70357a36cf26f771f5a083fc3598cf6c6-show-old-price-en.png",
        "Show old price",
        "Show old price"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


#### Distance between prices

Set the distance between the price and old price in pixels. The maximum value is 20 px.

      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/2daec15911a279f3b32d863d1843a392adf75f3aa626c75b63064244ec550e03-distance-between-prices-en.png",
        "Distance between prices",
        "Distance between prices"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


When selecting the _Maximum_ option, the prices within the block will be spaced as far apart as possible.

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


#### Alignment

Set the alignment of the prices: left, center or right.

        "https://files.readme.io/9dc62705cf33145c679cf5bc4ed416643ead72605a5716ab3970a49ba7c80c46-proce-alignment-en.png",

    }
  ]
}
[/block]


#### Price

You can set the following options in the _Price_ and _Old price_ sections:

1. Color, size, and font style.

  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/995e5ad8f984a2af375854c2c08413b220fe0ae01b2d395477b420066e6f500a-price-font-en.png",

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


2. Positioning the old price in relation to the new price: left, right, below or above.

      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/4d3e03af84da8424c0467f54cc92c277fb152093285f7b95a06bb10462f62ab3-old-price-right-en.png",
        "Positioning the old price",
        "Positioning the old price"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


#### Currency

Specify the font size separately in pixels, or match it to the price size.

  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/d4df94624e45aaba55d564e0a555339b91a9d6cb47794bcf02231314cc0c1d61-price-currency-text-size-en.png",
        "Currency",
        "Currency"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> If the prices' text sizes are different, changes to the currency font will only apply to the _Price_.

#### Paddings

The _Paddings_ options allow adjustment of space around the desktop or mobile versions.

You can set all margin values at once or individually for each side of the block. The maximum value is 40 px.Â 

To set up the individual value for each side of the block, enable the _More_ toggle and set the value.

        "Paddings"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
