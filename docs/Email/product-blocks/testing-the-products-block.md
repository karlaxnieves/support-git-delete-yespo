After [configuring the Products block](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/product-blocks), you can preview how the recommendations appear in the email on desktop and mobile devices.

You can test the block for an individual contact or a segment of contacts:

- If you are going to use the product block in a promo campaign, select a list of recipient contacts.
- If you are going to use the product block in a trigger campaign, select the dynamic segment on which the workflow with this email will be launched.

Consider an example of testing the _Products_ block for _Abandoned view_ workflow.Â 

## How to find out which segment is used in the workflow

1. Go toÂ _Automation_ â†’ _Workflows_, select the _Abandoned view_ workflow, and go to the _Start/Stop configuration_.

    }
  ]
}
[/block]


2. Copy the segmentâ€™s name or its _ID_ in the _Segment_ parameter.

        "https://files.readme.io/e241c24a592cf6e571ac76f7efa199ba0c2e9f430f499f1889c2e79c44579d42-testing-the-products-block-04.webp",

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


3. Select _Preview contacts from selected segment_ and paste the name or ID of the segment into the search field.

        "https://files.readme.io/b0500297acfe24c154d91833ecce7da61d105e0a006f5885a2a9a79a81603246-testing-the-products-block-05.webp",
        "Preview contacts from selected segment",
        "Preview contacts from selected segment"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


4. Select a contact for testing.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/10da8f8350134cd6ce2a84484ac494e8ba31de55d9ea84788fdc440ce1b24651-testing-the-products-block-06.webp",
        "Select a contact for testing",
        "Select a contact for testing"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


The message content will be generated differently depending on the following cases:

- **There is data available to display for a contact**

In this case, you will see the block content as the selected contact will see it.

    {

        "https://files.readme.io/454313dfc6e77591a38018e2cb03ed74ea9e54688e8a2ceea6a73ad04c95e286-testing-the-products-block-07.webp",
        "There is data available to display for a contact",
        "There is data available to display for a contact"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


- **There is no data available to display for a contact**

In this case, there are two possible options:

1. The preview will display a notification about the absence of recommendations, and the system will not send the email.

  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/05c50cd82dc8952f141faeccf0af1fd5b59b04457d1e4ef2410326d9f6bfaab4-testing-the-products-block-08.webp",
        "There is no data available to display for a contact: the system will not send the email",
        "There is no data available to display for a contact: the system will not send the email"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


2. The product block will be hidden, but the system will send the email.

[block:image]

  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/510fb80e400ffe23282cf0209199ea5c42462e6eda38ec34d89d9c65e17533b7-testing-the-products-block-09.webp",
        "There is no data available to display for a contact: the system will send the email",
        "There is no data available to display for a contact: the system will send the email"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


> ðŸ“˜ Note

> The display of the first or second option depends on the [If there are no products to show](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/using-the-products-block#if-there-are-no-products-to-show) setting in the _Products block_

If you deactivate the _Message for_ switcher, the recommendations will always display bestsellers from the general recommendation algorithms.
