For data exchange between Yespo and other systems, we recommend [API integration](https://docs.yespo.io/reference/getting-started-with-your-api) as the most efficient and flexible method.

To collect new contact information, you can use [Yespo widgets](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/widgets) â€” in this case, the data will be transferred directly to our system. 

We also offer already configured integration with sites on the Horoshop platform. Using it, you can transfer contacts and order data to our CDP without involving developers. [Integration instructions >](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/integrating-horoshop)
