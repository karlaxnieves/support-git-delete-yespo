<a rel="nofollow" href="https://horoshop.eu/" target="_blank"> Horoshop</a> is a SaaS platform for creating online stores. You can independently, without involving developers, set up the transfer of contact and order data from a website based on Horoshop to Yespo.

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> To integrate with Yespo on the Horoshop platform, activate the Pro tariff plan in your Horoshop account. Additionally, set up data transmission through API.

Before connecting a new integration, complete the following steps:

- [get a web tracking script](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/how-set-web-tracking-your-website),
- [import product feed into your account](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/importing-product-feed).

If you have already completed these steps, proceed directly to connecting and setting up a new integration.

## Connecting a New Integration in YourÂ Yespo Account

1. Go to the Yespo account settings â†’ _Integrations_ tab and click the _New integration_ button for the Horoshop service.

### Setting Up Integration Parameters

Activate the switches next to the functions you are going to use:

**Receive contacts**

- Contacts are received after the visitor has registered on the site or has placed an order.
- Contact data can include different parameters depending on the action completed on the site.
- Parameters received by default: email, first name, surname.

**Create contact with confirmed email address**

- If contacts did not provide explicit confirmation when collecting data, you must collect contacts unconfirmed.
- You can send both bulk and triggered messages to confirmed contacts.
- You can send only triggered messages to unconfirmed contacts.

**Receive orders**

You can use order data in workflows and messages.

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> Only the status _Initialized_Â is transmitted in orders.
