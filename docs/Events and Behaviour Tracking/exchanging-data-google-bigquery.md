Integrating Yespo with Google BigQuery opens up a world of data-driven possibilities for e-commerce marketers. By seamlessly exporting data from Yespo to BigQuery and importing valuable insights back into Yespo, brands can significantly improve campaign precision and personalization. This integration empowers businesses to harness advanced analytics, refine audience targeting, and personalize messaging to maximize engagement and conversions.

## Exporting Data to BigQuery

Exporting data from Yespo to BigQuery unlocks powerful analytics and insights to guide strategic decisions. With BigQuery’s processing capabilities, brands can:

- Assess campaign performance with detailed metrics,
- Optimize multi-channel attribution,
- Enhance segmentation and behavioral targeting.

These data-driven insights help brands understand customer journeys, ROI, and retention trends, providing the knowledge needed to optimize content, offers, and targeting for improved engagement and higher revenue.

## Importing Data from BigQuery

With data aggregated in BigQuery, you can create hyper-targeted campaigns in Yespo that feel uniquely relevant to each customer. By drawing on specific data points — such as engagement levels, past purchases, or browsing history — you can craft messages that resonate. For example, a campaign could congratulate a loyal customer on their fifth order, suggest products based on browsing habits, or offer discounts tailored to previous purchases. With BigQuery data imported back to Yespo, personalized campaigns reach new heights, fostering loyalty and increasing conversions.

## Setting Up Your Yespo and BigQuery Integration

### 1\. Link Your Yespo Account with Google BigQuery

Begin by connecting Yespo to BigQuery. This enables secure, seamless data flow between platforms, allowing exports and imports. See [the integration guide](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/google-bigquery-integration) for a detailed walkthrough.

### 2\. Set Up Data Export from Yespo to BigQuery

Configure your Yespo data export to BigQuery tables. This setup will allow Yespo to automatically send valuable datasets, like broadcast metrics, user activity, order details, and revenue data, directly to BigQuery, where you can perform in-depth analysis and reporting. See detailed instructions on setting up exports [here](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/exporting-data-bigquery-tables).

### 3\. Configure Data Import from BigQuery to Yespo

With your data now in BigQuery, you can set up imports to bring this data back into Yespo. Use data stored in BigQuery as a resource for building powerful audience segments or creating personalized messaging strategies based on user-specific behaviors and characteristics. Follow the data import setup guide [here](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/importing-data-bigquery-tables).
