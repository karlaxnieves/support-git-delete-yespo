2. Copy the script and add it to the page code before the closing `</body>` tag on every website page.

}

> ðŸ“˜ Important

> Install the script on both desktop and mobile versions of your website.

## Checking Script Status

After installing the script, click the _Check status_ button.

        "https://files.readme.io/dc5c185f4c943eca050546fd3743879e2e614fac12a178f38f1b2ad18f6ab2f5-Untitled-1.webp",
        "Check status",
        "Check status"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


If there are any problems, you will see a warning message with a hint.

  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/f898296fbdf9bf3c8e92c58243d1c305a1c92d0e7b2fb2ff26464f962bfcc07f-w-1.webp",
        "The script is not installed",
        "The script is not installed"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


When the installation is completed successfully, the status will change.

        "https://files.readme.io/a5e389c73a52323f084873c04d0900da5367964de751a05b7612106b550ef8f1-w-6.webp",
        "The script is installed",
        "The script is installed"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


Now you can return to the main web tracking page, where user activity on your site is tracked (_Settings â†’ Web tracking_).

        "Web tracking",
        "Web tracking"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


Here, you can see the number of page views yesterday and today and how many are unique. The _Additional events_ list will not display statistics until the [product feed](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/importing-product-feed) is loaded into the system and these events are configured. For stable operation of events, we recommend configuring their sending [by calling eS.JS functions](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/how-set-web-tracking-sending-events-java-scipt-request). This method allows you to independently control the transfer of data and promptly respond to changes on the site.
