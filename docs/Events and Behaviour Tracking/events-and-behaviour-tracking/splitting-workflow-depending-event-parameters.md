_The Condition block_ allows you to split the workflow depending on the parameters of the event that launched the workflow. These can be the following parameters:

- Category of the site visited by the contact
- City of residence
- Clothing size
- Product preferences
- Gender

For example, you need to send emails with selections of products for men and women, depending on gender, the value of which is passed in the event by the [Generate event](https://docs.yespo.io/reference/registerevent_1) API method:

```json
{
¬† ¬† "eventTypeKey": "event_name",
¬† ¬† "keyValue": "user@example.com",
¬† ¬† "params":
¬† ¬† [
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† {
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† "name": "EmailAddress",
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† "value": "user@example.com"
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† },
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† {
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† "name": "Name",
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† "value": "John"
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† },
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† {
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† "name": "lang",
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† "value": "EN"
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† },
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† {
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† "name": "gender",
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† "value": "M"
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† }
¬† ¬† ]
}
```

## Workflow Settings

1\. Create a workflow with two _Condition_ blocks that check the event parameters and send the contact to the appropriate branch. An example of such a workflow:

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/2662f926260be3d30f28083bfdb0f322654f047739a2ad0882ac428c1c4ce9cf-splitting-the-workflow-01.webp",
        "",
        "Workflow example"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


2\. Set up the first _Condition_ block:

1. Select [_Variable matches regular expression_](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/popular-blocks#variable-matches-regular-expression) in the _Task_ name field to check the contents of the gender parameter.

2. Add the name of the validation parameter in the _name_ field, in our case, it is _gender_.

3. Specify the value of the request parameter in the _pattern_ field in the following format: **.\*M.\*** (male).

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/950c63650ecc0919d46b658284b2341c7e9888dc6e4b359a747b246501e2ae9b-splitting-the-workflow-02.webp",
        "",
        "Block settings"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


> üìò Important
> 
> The case of the letter in the pattern field must match the case of the letter in the event parameters

3\. Add the second _Condition_ block to the workflow with the same settings as the first one, but with the **.\*F.\*** (female) pattern.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/ff43e906e2667038b9c549a797feca7354679a6be4e59db3341c0884bc552ebf-splitting-the-workflow-03.webp",
        "",
        "Block settings"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


If the event parameters match the value specified in the first condition, ¬†contacts will go along the ‚ÄúYes‚Äù branch; if not, they will go to the next checkpoint.

Contacts without gender specified in the request will go through the third workflow branch.
