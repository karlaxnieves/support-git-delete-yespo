An event is a signal about changes in the user profile. Events can be generated by changes in the profile field values, by user activity or inactivity (on the website, in campaigns), or by pre-configured API requests. They are used to launch triggered campaigns i. e. serve as triggers. As soon as the system receives a signal about a certain event (for example, a click or added product), it automatically launches the corresponding workflow.

Events can be generated both in the system and in external systems such as CRM or CMS. In the second case, events are sent to our platform via API.

## Event Categories

There are 6 event categories in our system:

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


1. **Click**: generated by a click on the link in the email assigned to the event. This is a default category. Read more on [how to assign a workflow to a CTA](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/how-add-scenario-button).
2. **Subscribe/Unsubscribe**: generated by a click on Subscribe/Unsubscribe in the [subscription form](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/subscription-form-configuration) or on the unsubscribe page. This is a service category that is configured by our support team when they create the corresponding form.
3. **RFM**: generated when subscribers migrate between segments depending on their activity. The category is chosen when you set up triggers based on RFM analysis (R – the time since the last activity (purchase/open); F – the frequency of purchases or opens; M – money customers spent). For example, you can set up a trigger when users move from the segment “bought 3 months ago” to the segment “bought 6 months ago” category, and send corresponding reactivation campaigns in time.
4. **[Import](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/how-to-launch-workflow-upon-import)**: a default category that is used to launch a workflow after contact import. You can also create other events in the Import category on your own. For example, import of male contacts only can launch one workflow, and import of female contacts only – another.
5. **Notification**: a service category that is automatically created after trigger failure alerts settings.
6. **Other**: generated by all custom events that can be created manually or sent via API, for example, website registration, adds to cart, etc.

Events from the categories Link and Other are most common, events from RFM and Import are less common. To facilitate the automation process, the following most often used events are available in the system by default:

- Confirmed subscription (Click);
- Import of new contacts (Import);
- Filled form (Subscribe/Unsubscribe).

## Creating an Event Type

You can create events in two ways:

- Automatically (via API, after setting up the launch conditions for regular workflow and workflow based on changes in the contact's field)
- Manually.

The event sent via API is automatically registered in the _Other_ category. Read more on API integration.

To create an event manually, go to _Automation → Event types_ and click _New event type_.

1\. Fill in _Name_ (required).

2\. Fill in _Key_ (required). A key is a unique event identifier that is registered in the system. You can fill in any text in Latin, with numbers allowed, for example, click, sale1, etc.

> 📘 Note
> 
> The main requirement is that the key should be unique for every event.

3. Add a description that will help you quickly identify what the event is used for. Next to the event type name in the general list, you will see a document icon; when you hover over it, a description will appear.

[block:image]

      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


4\. In _Category_, select the necessary event category.

5\. If you're subscribed to [Segmentation by user events](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/how-to-use-event-segmentation), enable _Use event for contact segmentation_. Segmentation primarily applies to user-generated events sent via API.

Note

To subscribe, please contact our sales team [sales@yespo.io](mailto:sales@yespo.io)

6\. Enable _Validate parameters_.

If the option is enabled, the system only accepts an event whose structure complies with the validation rules.

[More about Validating Event parameters >](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/validating-event-parameters)

7\. Click _Add_.

After this, a new event type appears in the _Event types_ list.

## Launching a Triggered Campaign on Event

Creation will differ depending on the event category, but the main steps are as follows:

### Step 1. Registration in the System

At this stage, you need to create an event in Yespo or provide integration with the system to send custom events via the API (see “[Creating an event](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/creating-events#creating-an-event-type)”).

Create an event manually or send it via API. All created events are displayed in _Automation → Event types_.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/06e16913c83cecfd9afc425c9a1411997dac2271a8b460edd5be9091a115d953-events-for-trigger-campaigns-000.webp",
        "Create an Event Type",
        "Create an Event Type"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


### Step 2. Create a Workflow

Create a workflow that will be launched by the created event. For example:

- [click in the message](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/how-add-scenario-button) (_Click_);
- subscription (_Subscribe/Unsubscribe_);
- import of new contacts (_Import_);
- migration of subscribers from active to passive (_RFM_);
- website and app activity (_Other, Subscription, View_);
- order (_initialized, in progress, delivered, canceled_).

1. Go to _Automation_ → _Workflows_ and click _New workflow_.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/a1351df31c4ad5863447bb53dfbad07caa89f7f7d9d301dc7ea9e25b290e6c74-event-type-parameters-en-06.webp",
        "Create a workflow",
        "Create a workflow"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


2. Enter the workflow name and description (optionally).
3. Build the workflow by dragging the necessary blocks and connecting them.

This is an example of the workflow that will be triggered by a click on the _Learn more_ button in the message. All contacts that have clicked this button will be added to a separate segment _Opened_, and will receive an additional message with details of the previous offer.

[block:image]

  "images": [
    {
      "image": [

        "Building the workflow"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


> 📘 Note
> 
> To extract the data out of order and pass it to the message, use [Get order](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/popular-blocks#get-order) block

### Step 3. Link the Event to the Workflow

1. Go to _Automation_ → _Workflows_ and click _Trigger configuration_.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/a7e95b2ef1d0ea0f18c8c7d55d39cd5a681f620325010b48b9496af86c67a99e-c9dfcca-launching-a-riggered-campaign-on-event-004.webp",
        "Trigger configuration",
        "Trigger configuration"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


2. In pop-up window activate _Start configuration_ switcher and select the event.
3. Click the _Event-based_ tab and select one of the process unique events option:

- **Each time**: to launch the workflow each time when receiving the event. For example, choose this option for the triggered workflow _Order_. Each time your customer makes an order, they will receive a corresponding message (for example, confirmation). If they make 3 separate orders per day, they will receive 3 messages.
- **Once**: to launch the workflow only once regardless of the number of events sent by the same contact. For example, choose this option for a [welcome series](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/how-create-welcome-email-series) after the first purchase: no matter how many orders the customer makes, they will receive only one welcome series.
- **Once in every \_\_\_\_ hours/days/weeks/months**: to launch the workflow once within a given period of time. For example, choose once in 1 hour for abandoned carts. If the same customer abandons cart 3 times in an hour, the workflow will process only one event and send only one message.

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


4. Click _Apply_.  
   The event will appear in _Launch conditions_ of the configured workflow. The workflow will appear in _Linked workflow_ of the assigned event.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


### Step 4. Launch the Workflow

Click the _Activate_ icon and confirm your action.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/b2dd46e72e2f4725f895a8c896cd14325e370e33fd98503b153d0582b0c6ea5e-762d044-launching-a-riggered-campaign-on-event-007.webp",

        "Workflow activation"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


The status of the workflow will change to active.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/c2b9a484678d4d2792bf6eb1fd8230e0151f73907e7eb9e3891fbb9aed9c319b-10a2da4-launching-a-riggered-campaign-on-event-008.webp",

        "Workflow status"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


After you link the event to the workflow, this event will trigger the workflow launch for the contact whose information (email address, phone number, token) is sent in the event. Contact information is sent in an integral part of the event.

```json
{ "params": [ { "name": "ContactId", "value": "22222" }, { "name": "EmailAddress", "value": "youremail@gmail.com" } ] }
```

## Viewing, sorting, and validating event parameters

Go to _Automation → Event types_ to view available event types.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/99509c6c61b2f90f4c844d75095d6e7b20a259c3bd1b6eed53734409560a7230-sort-events-by-metrics-01.webp",

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


### Activity Statuses

To sort events by activity, select the appropriate filter:

- All statuses
- Active
- Inactive

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/6d089dce74d6f2556bc18448b7402975619c500bc9bf1bc701f0293fd6cff7f8-sort-events-by-metrics-02.webp",
        "Activity statuses",
        "Activity statuses"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


At the top of the list, is a set of additional filters to sort events by specific metrics.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/a1d20886c9dc5b7afda3263e21999693848cf9197f10b2b3b275b4e71cfc57f8-sort-events-by-metrics-03.webp",

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


You can sort from highest to lowest value and vice versa.

### Event Type Dependencies

Event type dependencies represent the relation between the event type and a workflow or dynamic segment.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/08746d3ab7f58a689ab951278d12cea5247c66e2e646aff73cba237a401add45-sort-events-by-metrics-04.webp",

- Without dependencies.

> 📘 Note
> 
> One event type can have multiple related workflows and dynamic segments. In this case, dependencies are grouped, and their quantity is displayed.

Event types created for regular workflows and workflows based on contact field changes contain:

- Segment name, segment ID.
- Contact field name, contact field ID.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [

## Event History

You can view the events sent to the system in _Automation_ → _Event history_.

        "https://files.readme.io/429bfe6d34625c4032076188c837a23277b50c58839d3a73d07c7e842c5e322e-3492499-launching-a-riggered-campaign-on-event-009.webp",

      ],

      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


If no events have been sent, the tab will be empty.

You can track events sent to Yespo, filter them by name and time, and search by key.

Event type, its key, linked workflow, the contact found (if event segmentation is used), and time when the event is registered, are displayed in the general list of events.
