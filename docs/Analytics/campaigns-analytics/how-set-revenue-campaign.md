Enable the visualization of revenue in reports to see how much income each channel generates.

## Enabling Revenue Display

1. The first step is to set up order data transfer to the system via API resources *[Add orders](https://docs.yespo.io/reference/ordersbulkinsert-1)* and *[Generate event](https://docs.yespo.io/reference/registerevent_1)*. You can see order information in *Automation â†’ Orders* if integration is active.

2. Go to your profile *Settings â†’ Revenue from campaigns* and enable the *Show sales in report* option.

3. Activate the *Associate with last received message* switcher and select parameters for each channel:

* The event that connects the channel to sale (*Opened, Sent, Clicked, Delivered*);
* The time between the event and sale (hours, days, weeks).

Different parameters can be set for each channel.

4. Specify the order currency to calculate the income. Select a currency code from the list and click the *Save* button.Â Revenue visualization will include only orders in the specified currency.

Add [message tags](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/how-add-tags) to exclude specific messages from the revenue calculation (technical notifications, password recovery, delivery confirmation, etc.)Â Data on them will be available in the report but wonâ€™t be included in the revenue calculation.Â

## Period Revenue

Revenue from the campaign is also displayed inside its report:

Next to the numbers, you can see the sale formula. For example, for the campaign on the screen, a sale is defined as a transition from the message to the website with purchase completion within 24 hours after the transition.

## Notes

* Set up order data transfer to the system via API resources *Add orders* and *Generate event*.
* The *Reports*Â tab displays only orders with the *Delivered* status.
* All sales transferred to the system are connected to channels. You connect channels to sales in *Settings* based on events (sent, delivered, opened, clicked) and time period.
* A sale is always associated with the last interaction with the channel.
* Refund data isnâ€™t included in the general statistics.
