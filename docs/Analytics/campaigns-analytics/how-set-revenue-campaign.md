Enable the visualization of revenue in reports to see how much income each channel generates.

## Enabling Revenue Display

1. The first step is to set up order data transfer to the system via API resources _[Add orders](https://docs.yespo.io/reference/ordersbulkinsert-1)_ and _[Generate event](https://docs.yespo.io/reference/registerevent_1)_. You can see order information in _Automation â†’ Orders_ if integration is active.

    }
  ]
}

2. Go to your profile _Settings â†’ Revenue from campaigns_ and enable the _Show sales in report_ option.

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


3. Activate the _Associate with last received message_ switcher and select parameters for each channel:

- The event that connects the channel to sale (_Opened, Sent, Clicked, Delivered_);
- The time between the event and sale (hours, days, weeks).

Different parameters can be set for each channel.

    }
  ]
}

Add [message tags](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/how-add-tags) to exclude specific messages from the revenue calculation (technical notifications, password recovery, delivery confirmation, etc.)Â Data on them will be available in the report but wonâ€™t be included in the revenue calculation.Â

Revenue from the campaign is also displayed inside its report:

      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


Next to the numbers, you can see the sale formula. For example, for the campaign on the screen, a sale is defined as a transition from the message to the website with purchase completion within 24 hours after the transition.

## Notes

- Set up order data transfer to the system via API resources _Add orders_ and _Generate event_.
- The _Reports_Â tab displays only orders with the _Delivered_ status.
- All sales transferred to the system are connected to channels. You connect channels to sales in _Settings_ based on events (sent, delivered, opened, clicked) and time period.
- A sale is always associated with the last interaction with the channel.
- Refund data isnâ€™t included in the general statistics.
