The first part of the report contains the following data:

1. The messageâ€™s and segmentâ€™s names.
2. Start and finish date and time.Â 
3. Email of the user who started the campaign.

> ðŸ“˜ Note

> The section with general information is considered in the example of the *Email* channel. Other channels have minor differences due to their specifics.

## Performance Indicators

Statistics of openings, clicks, etc., are revealed in a table and do not differ from the performance indicators of a usual campaign.

Detailed statistics for each language version are located under the general report.

## Multilanguage in Opens and Clicks (Email)

The plates with the languages used in the campaign are in the *Opens and clicks* section under each tab (*Click map, Table of clicks, AMP*). Combine metrics tabs and language plates to see the corresponding statistics for the language version of your campaign.

## Multilanguage Performance Metrics in the Web Widget Channel

Find theÂ multilingual widget statistics in the corresponding [report](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/widget-analytics) tab. Here, you can see the total number of views and clicks for all widget language versions and for each language separately.

## Multilanguage Performance Metrics Across Other Channels

The *Multilingual* tab for all other multilingual channels appears in the detailed statistics, where the performance indicators of different language versions of the message are presented as a table. In addition, you can apply additional filtering by sent messages, errors, or by opened.

## Detailing Performance Indicators

The *Multilingual* parameter is located on the *Add details* tab. Select it from the list to see any statistics for all language versions of the campaign.

The statistics available may differ depending on the channel, but the principle of viewing the effectiveness of different language versions of the campaign remains the same.
