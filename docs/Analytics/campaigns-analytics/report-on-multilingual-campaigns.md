## Performance Indicators

Statistics of openings, clicks, etc., are revealed in a table and do not differ from the performance indicators of a usual campaign.

Detailed statistics for each language version are located under the general report.

## Multilanguage in Opens and Clicks (Email)

The plates with the languages used in the campaign are in the _Opens and clicks_ section under each tab (_Click map, Table of clicks, AMP_). Combine metrics tabs and language plates to see the corresponding statistics for the language version of your campaign.
