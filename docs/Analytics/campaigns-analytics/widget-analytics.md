Information about widgets is available in two sections:

1. **Reports** (*Campaigns → Reports*): viewed and clicked statistics, activity dynamics, revenue by identified users with *Contact ID*.
2. **Analytics** (*Site → Widgets*): unique views, subscriptions, clicks, conversion, new contacts and activity dynamics by all widget interactions.

You can also check out [general reports’ capabilities](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/campaigns-analytics).

## 1. Reports 

Conventionally, the report consists of 4 parts:

1. General information.
2. Performance indicators.
3. Revenue.
4. Detailed statistics.

### 1. General Information 

The first part of the report contains the following data:

1. The widget’s name.
2. Public date.
3. Widget ID. To copy an ID, click on the copy icon next to it. Click on the link icon to edit a widget.
4. Widget preview.

### 2. Performance Indicators

Yespo automatically tracks the performance of widgets, including views and clicks. Statistics are presented in a table.

Green marks on the scale show the conditional indicators of a successful campaign, and red marks are negative indicators' conditional norm.

Clicking on any report item opens a window for viewing the contacts list.

Above the general statistics are the following tabs:

* Export. Allows you to export contacts from the report to a CSV file, to an existing or a new list. Export is available for all campaign metrics: viewed and clicked.
* More. Allows you to delete the report.

### 3. Revenue

If you set up integration with a CRM system that records order data, you can evaluate the revenue from widget.

### 4. Detailed Statistics

Using the *Add details* option, you can filter the data from the *Activity dynamics,* *Revenue* and *Multilanguage* tabs by segments or language versions of the widget.

#### Multilanguage (optional)

Multilanguage is an automation tool that enables sending messages in different languages within one campaign. It helps avoid long message lists and voluminous, unsystematic reports for every message.\
Reports on multilingual campaigns are described in a special article.
