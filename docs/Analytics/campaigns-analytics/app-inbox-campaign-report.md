App Inbox campaign reports provide information about the campaign results, including response time, contact device languages, and profitability.

Let’s consider the features of bulk reports. You can also check out

* [additional options for trigger reports](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/triggered-campaign-report);
* [general reports’ capabilities](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/campaigns-analytics).

Conventionally, the report consists of 4 parts:

1. General information.
2. Performance indicators.
3. Revenue.
4. Detailed statistics.

## 2. Performance Indicators

Yespo automatically tracks the effectiveness of App Inbox campaigns, including opens, clicks, errors, etc. All statistics are collected as a table.

Green marks on the scale show the conditional indicators of a successful campaign, and red marks are negative indicators' conditional norm.

Clicking on any report item opens a window for viewing the contacts list.

Above the general statistics are the following tabs:

* **Extra campaigns.** Allows you to configure the automatic sending of messages based on the activity or inactivity of users regarding this campaign. More — [at the link](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/how-send-extra-campaign).
* **Export.** Allows you to export contacts from the report to a CSV file, to an existing or a new list. Export is available for all campaign metrics: sent, delivered, inaccessible contacts when sending, over plan limit, [annoyance level](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/management-campaign-frequency) exceeded, etc.
* **More.** Allows you to delete the report.

## 3. Revenue

If you set up integration with a CRM system that records order data, you can evaluate the financial results of the campaign.

### Multilanguage (optional)

Multilanguage is an automation tool that enables sending messages in different languages within one campaign. It helps avoid long message lists and voluminous unsystematic reports for every message.

Reports on multilingual campaigns are described [in a special article](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/report-on-multilingual-campaigns).

### Adding Details

You can filter tabs’ data using the *Add details* option.
