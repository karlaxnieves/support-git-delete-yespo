Viber campaign reports provide information on campaign results, including key metrics, contact statistics, and revenue.

Letâ€™s consider the features of bulk reports. You can also check out

- [additional options for trigger reports](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/triggered-campaign-report),
- [general reportsâ€™ capabilities](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/campaigns-analytics).

Conventionally, the report consists of 4 parts:

1. General information.
2. Performance indicators.
3. Revenue.
4. Detailed statistics.

Clicking on any report item opens a window for viewing the contacts list.

## 3. Revenue

If you set up integration with a CRM system that records order data, you can evaluate the financial results of the campaign.

### Multilanguage (optional)

Multilanguage is an automation tool that enables sending messages in different languages within one campaign. It helps avoid long message lists and voluminous unsystematic reports for every message.  
Reports on multilingual campaigns are described [in a special article](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/report-on-multilingual-campaigns).

### Adding Details

You can filter tabsâ€™ data using the _Add details_ option.
