SMS reports provide information about the results of your campaigns, including key metrics, contact statistics, and revenue.

Let’s consider the features of bulk reports. You can also check out

- [additional options for trigger reports](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/triggered-campaign-report);
- [general reports’ capabilities](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/campaigns-analytics).

Conventionally, the report consists of 4 parts:

1. General information.
2. Performance indicators.
3. Revenue.
4. Detailed statistics.

Green marks on the scale show the conditional indicators of a successful campaign, and red marks are negative indicators' conditional norm.

Clicking on any report item opens a window for viewing the contacts list.

## 3. Revenue

If you set up integration with a CRM system that records order data, you can evaluate the financial results of the campaign.

### Multilanguage (optional)

Multilanguage is an automation tool that enables sending messages in different languages within one campaign. It helps avoid long message lists and voluminous unsystematic reports for every message.

Reports on multilingual campaigns are described [in a special article](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/report-on-multilingual-campaigns).

### Adding Details

You can filter tabs’ data using the _Add details_ option.
