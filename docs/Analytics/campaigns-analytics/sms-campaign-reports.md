SMS reports provide information about the results of your campaigns, including key metrics, contact statistics, and revenue.

Letâ€™s consider the features of bulk reports. You can also check out

* [additional options for trigger reports](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/triggered-campaign-report);
* [general reportsâ€™ capabilities](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/campaigns-analytics).

Conventionally, the report consists of 4 parts:

1. General information.
2. Performance indicators.
3. Revenue.
4. Detailed statistics.

## 1. General Information

The first part of the report contains the following data:

* The messageâ€™s and segmentâ€™s names.
* Campaign start/finish date and time.
* Email of the user who started the campaign.
* Message preview: shows how the message is displayed on iOS and Android.
* Message ID. To copy an ID, click on the copy icon next to it. Click on the link icon to edit a message.
* Name.
* The number of message parts.
* The segment of contacts to whom the message was sent, segment ID, and the date of the segmentâ€™s last editing.
* [Tags](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/how-add-tags) to find and filter messages.

## 2. Performance Indicators

Yespo automatically tracks the performance of SMS campaigns, includingÂ clicks, errors, delivery etc. Statistics are presented in a table.

Green marks on the scale show the conditional indicators of a successful campaign, and red marks are negative indicators' conditional norm.

Clicking on any report item opens a window for viewing the contacts list.

## 3. Revenue

If you set up integration with a CRM system that records order data, you can evaluate the financial results of the campaign.

### Multilanguage (optional)

Multilanguage is an automation tool that enables sending messages in different languages within one campaign. It helps avoid long message lists and voluminous unsystematic reports for every message.

Reports on multilingual campaigns are described [in a special article](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/report-on-multilingual-campaigns).

### Adding Details

You can filter tabsâ€™ data using the *Add details* option.
