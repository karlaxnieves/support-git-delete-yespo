Google Analytics 4 (GA4) is a new version of the Google Analytics platform that provides deeper and more complete tools for event analysis, unlike Google Universal Analytics, where the emphasis is on sessions. Event tracking allows you to collect data about user interactions with brands more flexibly and detailedly. Instructions for getting started with GA4 are available <a rel="nofollow" href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10089681?hl=en" target="_blank">here</a>.

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> Check the settings for transferring UTM tags in your Yespo account: it must be activated. Learn more about [UTM tags](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/how-transfer-utm-parameter).

There is no need to additional configure Yespo integration with Google Analytics.

## Channel Analysis

GA4 displays statistics by channels on

- Users,
- Sessions,
- Interactions,
- Events,
- Revenue (Revenue data is available if you configured <a rel="nofollow" href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10089681?hl=en" target="_blank">sending e-commerce events</a> from your website or mobile app in analytics).

To check the collection and mapping of data to a channel, go to the _Acquisition â†’ Traffic acquisition â†’ Session primary channel group_ section. The email channel report is included in analytics by default; setting up the display of other media channels is described below.

Specify the date range for analysis in one of the following ways:

- click on the first and last date of the required period in the calendar;
- write them in the appropriate column in the date range;
- select the default period.

You can set two date ranges to compare the dynamics of results: check the _Compare_ checkbox and specify the date ranges.

> ðŸš§ Important
> 
> Of the channels available in Yespo, analytics by default only displays Email, SMS, and Mobile Push Notifications, where web push indicators are also collected. Other channels are included in the _Unassigned_ or _(other)_ statistics. Set up channel distribution manually.

Â Add UTMs to the list with utm\_medium parameters to match them with the corresponding channel.Â 

1. At the bottom left, open the _Administrator_ tab.
2. Go to _Property settings â†’ Data display â†’ Channel groups_.
3. Click _Create new channel group_ (creating a new group is required to set the procedure for checking traffic data for compliance with the channel).

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/31075dad69c94df99046a5d3d2cb353eb7a650d53947566ef3b4ca0dd8379ce7-ga4-6.webp",

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


Provide channel information:

1. Enter its name.
2. Configure the rule by which you will transmit the channel in the medium parameter.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/0e57350ca2222739ce2cde11ae60bf0c32bd4991f766071170220dabf2b8e9c6-ga4-7.webp",

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


When creating a channel group, pay attention to the order in which they are placed. If the rule definition is repeated in channels, Google will record the traffic of the first channel in the list. For example, traffic is read as a referral, and if the _Referral_ channel is higher in order than _Social_, place the channel definition you added above the others (the _Reorder_ button). The data in the reports will be updated after 24 hours.

## Trigger and Promo Campaign AnalysisÂ 

Yespo transfers Yespo-promo and Yespo-trigger UTM tags, by which you can distribute the reports' data.

Open the _Acquisition â†’ Traffic acquisition_ tab, select _Session source / medium_ from the list, and click _Add filter_.

[block:image]

    {

      ],
      "align": "center",

    }
  ]
}
[/block]


Create a filter:

1. Dimension: _Session source / medium_.
2. Match type: _exactly matches_.
3. Value: _Yespo-promo / channel name_ and _Yespo-trigger / channel name_.

## Single Campaigns Analysis

To evaluate the effectiveness of individual promo or trigger campaigns, apply the _Yespo-promo / channel name_ or _Yespo-trigger / channel name_ filters on the _Acquisition â†’ Traffic acquisition â†’ Session source / medium_ tab. Select _Session campaign_ in the _Session source / medium_ column.

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


## Messagesâ€™ Series Analysis

You can evaluate the effectiveness of a messagesâ€™ series by their [tags](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/how-add-tags) in Yespo. All messages must have the same tags in the same number and order. Otherwise, GA will consider the messages to be from different campaigns.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/26d7c6d165c0fad5cca65d46a0405d78aa59f3e4a6d59b1b2ce92726f778188f-ga4-13.webp",

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


To evaluate the effectiveness of a series of messages, select the _Session keyword_ parameter from the _Custom_ list in the _Session source / medium_ column on the _Acquisition â†’ Traffic acquisition_ tab.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/536cd70b4831625c3d696abbfc348f711473822af17cdb62b7c9006146bc0989-ga4-18.webp",

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


If your GA4 account does not have a _Session keyword_ parameter, set it up.

1. Go to _Property settings â†’ Data display â†’ Custom definitions_ in the admin panel.
2. Create a custom definition on the _Custom dimensions_ tab:Â 

- Dimension name â€” _Session keyword_,
- Description â€“ _utm\_term value_,
- Scope â€” _Event_,
- User property/parameter â€“ _term_.

    }

## Contact Tracking by ID

You can track contactsâ€™ purchasing activity using their [external IDs](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/external-id-creating-and-updating-users).

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/67437754131535212bfa5ed3a870eccee8d3e059e137127a4719110d0d3e865a-ga4-16.webp",

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


Pass the _$contactId_ in the _Contact ID_ parameter (Yespo settings â†’ _Links_). It is included in the _utm\_content_ field by default.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/24cb56a3f9162a289e6c7b05692a4f8c98af05a6321749f30a50cd4bb78abca1-ga4-17-yespo.webp",

        "$contactId"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


To evaluate the contact's purchasing activity, select the _Session content_ parameter from the _Custom_ list in the _Session source / medium_ column on the _Acquisition â†’ Traffic acquisition_ tab.

![Session content](https://files.readme.io/d3b58656c1431a4dfc6de4430bf2088046ff3b853cae6005189fd1444bc476ff-ga4-14.webp "Session content")  
Â If your GA4 account does not have the \_Session content p_arameter, set it up.

1. Go to _Property settings â†’ Data display â†’ Custom definitions_ in the admin panel.
2. Create a custom definition on the _Custom dimensions_ tab:Â 

- Dimension name â€” _Session content_,
- Description â€“ _utm\_content value_,
- Scope â€” _Event_,
- User property/parameter â€“ _content_.

> ðŸš§ Important

> Client ID (cid) and User ID (uid) are used in GA and must be integrated into the site's tracking code. They help analyze user behavior, providing crucial information for overall analysis. Contact your developer or analyst for detailed information about these identifiers and their settings.

## Explorations

Explorations are custom reports for tracking more detailed statistics on customer behavior.

To create an exploration, go to the _Studies_ tab and create a new exploration or select a template from the gallery.
