Reports provide statistical campaign information and are available in the _Campaigns â†’ Reports_ section.

Reports display a table of all your campaigns with their respective statuses, the number of contacts who participated in them, and the effectiveness of each campaign.

## Bulk & Triggered Campaigns

There are 2 types of campaigns depending on the sending way:

- Bulk â€“ one-time sending of one message to a group of contacts. For example, promo or newsletters.
- [Triggered](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/triggered-campaign-report) â€” automatic campaigns based on specific actions of the contact, such as subscription, purchase, review, and so on.

To see the message and widget preview in the bottom right-hand side corner, point to the widget or message name in the _Reports_ column.

}
[/block]


### Filtering Reports

Reports are displayed as a list and automatically sorted by the start date of the campaigns â€” the newest ones appear at the top. If needed, you can set a custom period or use one of the preset intervals.

[block:image]

        "https://files.readme.io/e116db03860166ee10218fcd5db436bcf9fd492608a85c139e0602f9bb1b22ac-lifetime_en.png",

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }

### Setting Up Report Displaying

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/d4bf0fa6f442a268d3782258b0f50828b4d72704fa0dd9d71dbd5a5b0888908b-reports-06.webp",
        "Highlighted campaigns",
        "Display tab"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


The _Display_ tab allows you to:

1. Highlight the campaigns by the best and the worst indicators.

Activate the _Highlight best and worst campaigns_ switch. The best metrics will be highlighted in green and the worst â€” in red.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/bf24cc9e1073346778c8d9887e19a8dcafc806d48d1bc12e4ab510e0716a4cd2-reports-07.webp",
        "Highlighted campaigns",
        "Highlighted campaigns"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


2. Change the number of reports displayed on the page: 5, 10, 25, 50, or 100.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/501c44fbeee0329f3e6cfbf27c24b804dea436754dc9dca6a1d4cda3c948d55f-reports-08.webp",
        "Number of reports per page",
        "Number of reports per page"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


3. Hide or add columns with indicators to the list of reports. For example, hide the categories of unsubscribed contacts or display the number of purchases.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/46bb18a0cbae83c70726445d5847e9b351e2c828868d0c9228e582db7c21089b-reports-09.gif",
        "Adding columns with indicators",
        "Adding columns with indicators"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


## Single Reports

Single messages are sent via workflows and APIs, as well as test messages from the message editor.

See single reportsÂ in the _Campaigns â†’ Single reports_ section.

They are displayed as message lists and contain the following data:

- Receiver
- Message
- Date
- Result

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/ab1ef19edea0dd50318e963185ebd9b0afc559d1e52105a35d721bb377d4ac75-single-en.webp",
        "Single reports",
        "Single reports"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


The options for managing the _Single reports_ section are similar to reports for bulk and triggered campaigns.

## Special Icons

- The _copy_ icon will help you quickly paste data into Excel or Google Sheets.
- The _percent_ icon shows the data as a percentage.
- The _00_ icon shows statistics in numbers.

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


Multilingual messages in the lists are marked with a globe icon. The number next to it indicates the number of language versions.

    }
  ]
}
[/block]

## Managing Active Campaigns

Reports on campaigns that are in the process of being sent contain _Pause_ and _Stop_ buttons at the top, with which you can wholly or temporarily stop the campaign. To restart it, click the _Start_ button.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/9607402f53e88aaae31dc849f7bf39d40cbd3bad00a7912c62836150cde6550d-image13.webp",
        "Active campaign",
        "Active campaign"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


The system could also pause the campaign automatically. It happens if:

- There needs to be more funds in your account.
- The email has [unique promo codes](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/promocodes) that have expired.

After you fund your account or update the list of promo codes, you can un-pause the campaign by clicking on the _Start_ button.
