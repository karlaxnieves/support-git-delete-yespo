The unsubscribe page is essential to allow users to easily opt out of receiving emails. This helps maintain the quality of the contact database, comply with data protection regulations (such as GDPR), and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/10979322?hl=en&ref_topic=3395756&sjid=8827293139908704359-EU" target="_blank"> adhere to Gmail's recommendations for sending bulk emails</a>.

By default, a standard unsubscribe block is placed in the footer of every email sent via our system.

When editing this block, follow these requirements:

- The link must be visible.
- The link text should explicitly indicate the option to unsubscribe.
- Unsubscribing should be straightforward, without unnecessary steps (e.g., registration or authorization).

## Unsubscribe Options

Yespo offers the following unsubscribe options: one-click, two-click, and subscription category-based.

Let's explore the differences between them.

- **One-click unsubscribe**. The user clicks the unsubscribe link in the email and automatically receives the Unsubscribed status.

The unsubscribe page features a Re-Subscribe button and a field to provide feedback on why unsubscribe.

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


- **Two-click unsubscribe**. First, the user clicks the link in the email, and only after clicking the unsubscribe button again, they receive the Unsubscribed status.

This page includes fields for selecting unsubscribe reasons and for leaving a review.

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


- **Subscription category-based.** A customized unsubscribe page where the user chooses which specific categories of emails they wish to unsubscribe from.

This option's advantage is that the user retains their subscription and continues to receive information only from the selected categories. This provides an alternative that helps retain subscribers.

    }
  ]
}
[/block]


In addition to standard unsubscribe pages, you can set up custom pages with:

- branding in your corporate style, including a logo and text;
- a survey to gather reasons for unsubscribing;
- an option to subscribe to social media or other channels;
- the ability to update subscriptions based on specific categories.

To set up an unsubscribe page with category options, send a request to [support@yespo.io](mailto:support@yespo.io).

## Unsubscribe Reasons

If the unsubscribe page includes a field for comments or reasons, you can view data in the _Campaigns_ → _Unsubscribe reasons_ section.

> 📘 Note
> 
> If a contact unsubscribes without selecting or specifying a reason, their opt-out will be recorded but won’t appear in the _Unsubscribe reasons_ section.

Analyze the data to identify factors leading to email unsubscribes. This will help you reduce the unsubscribe rate in the future.

> ❗️ Important
> 
> The acceptable unsubscribe rate should not exceed 1%. If this rate is higher, the Yespo support team may block your campaigns, as they could be flagged as spam according to the [Yespo service terms](https://yespo.io/terms-of-use).
