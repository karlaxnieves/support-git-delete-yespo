Let's consider each section in more detail.

## ChannelÂ Overview

The chart shows the distribution of contacts by channels, with the number of contacts in each. If a channel is missing from the database, its field will not be displayed or included in the calculations

> ðŸ“˜ Note

> The overview shows statistics for the last elapsed day; recalculation ends before 02:00 UTC

## Activity Overview

The section is divided into tabs by channels, where the following data is displayed for each channel:

- charts of the contact base by activity;
- contact growth overview;
- subscriber engagement overview.

### Charts of the Contact Base by Activity

The pie chart displays the contact database structure based on the activity of different subscriber categories. All elements of the chart are interactive and color-coded: clicking on any segment reveals its structure in the selected channel.

Statistics categories:

**Active subscribers**. Contacts included in the campaign in the last 3 months:

- opened;
- opened and clicked â€” opened and clicked the link from the email.

**Inactive subscribers**. Contacts who received the campaign but were not sufficiently engaged:

- opened over 3 months ago;
- never opened;
- soft-bounced â€” an email exists, but message delivery is impossible. For example, the mailbox is full, temporarily blocked, etc. If the status changes (for example, the email address becomes inactive after a year), such contact will fall to the Black List category;
- unconfirmed â€” contacts who indicated their email in the subscription form but did not confirm it. The reasons may differ â€” an error in the address, filling out the form by a bot, etc.

**Lost subscribers**. Contacts that previously participated in campaigns but are now unavailable for the following reasons:

- unsubscribed;
- reported spam;
- blacklisted â€” you or another user sent messages to this address, and the mail service answered that the mail does not exist. Such an address is blacklisted and no longer participates in the campaign. The blacklist is end-to-end, that is, you upload an email address to the system, and it may already be on the blacklist.

**Never sent**. Contacts you have never sent campaigns to. For example, a contact was previously blacklisted or was accidentally removed from a campaign segment. Here you can see the following statistics:

- unsubscribed;
- reported spam;
- blacklisted;
- unconfirmed;
- available â€” addresses available for the campaign.

#### Web Push, Mobile Push, App Inbox, In-App, Telegram

Let's examine the chart using Web Push as an example, as the statistics for the mentioned channels are built based on the same categories of contacts:

**Active subscribers**. Contacts included in the campaign in the last 3 months:

- opened (_Web Push,_Â _App inbox_ and _In-App_ channels);
- opened and clicked.

**Inactive subscribers**. Contacts who get the campaign but were not sufficiently engaged:

- opened over 3 months ago;
- never opened.

**Never sent**. Contacts you have never sent campaigns to.

#### Exporting contacts with different activity statuses to the segmentsÂ 

Let's consider the export of contacts using the _Email_ channel as an example.

1. Go to the chart and select contacts from the desired category.

        "Exporting contacts"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


2. Click the _Create a segment_ button in pop-up window.Â 

[block:image]

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


The segment will appear in the _Contacts â†’ Segments_ section in the overall list of groups. The contact data is current as of the moment of export to the segment.
