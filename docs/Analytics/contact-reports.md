[Export contacts directly from the reports](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/exporting-subscriber-groups-reports) in your account, depending on their reaction to the campaign. For example, export those who clicked on some specific link in the email.

Use built-in [cohort](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/cohort-analysis-how-track-segment-activity) and [RFM reports](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/rfm-analysis) to monitor the quality of your communications and contactsâ€™ activity.
