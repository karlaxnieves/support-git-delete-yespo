Product recommendations are an effective marketing tool. You can display personalized product [recommendations in emails](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/how-set-product-recommendations-email) and on the [site](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/product-recommendations-website) to generate repeat sales and grow customer retention.

Using the _[Contact recommendations based on web tracking](https://docs.yespo.io/reference/contactrecoms-1)_Â resource, you can transfer data on customer preferences to other channels and offer recommendations based on it.

- Messengers;
- Call centers;
- Pickup points;
- Mobile apps.

## How to Use _Contact Recommendations Based on Web Tracking_

The transfer of recommendations through _Contact recommendations based on web tracking_ will allow operators/cashiers to generate repeat sales offering products based on customer shopping history.

**Example 1**

When calling the customer to confirm the order, the manager sees a list of recommendations for the bought products and personal recommendations for this customer, if any.

**Example 2**

When making an offline purchase, the customer provides their discount card or tells the phone number to earn account bonuses. The system identifies the customer and shows the additional recommendations for them.

## What Product Categories Can Be Recommended

- **Alternatives to out-of-stock products**.
- **Also bought**. Cross-sell based on items added to the cart.
- **You may also like**. Upsell of more expensive items and complementary goods to increase the order price.
- **Bestsellers**. Recommendations based on orders by other customers.
- **Personal recommendations** based on the customerâ€™s purchase history.
- **Other**. Recommendations created not using ourÂ algorithms.

Important

You need to send requests for each recommendation type because they have different data sources.

## How to Use Recommendations

- [Set web tracking](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/how-set-web-tracking-your-website) and upload a product feed.
- [Subscribe to a pricing plan](https://yespo.io/tarif-universum) covering Advanced Segmentation.
- Create a data source and select the necessary algorithm.

You need to create a data source for each recommendation type. Its ID will be used for an API call.
