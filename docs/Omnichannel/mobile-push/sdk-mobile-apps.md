Our SDK is a software development kit for app developers and marketers. It includes a range of API methods that automate integration between your app and our CDP. 

The SDK allows you to register installations, sessions, in-app events, and automatically add and update user data. Integrating the SDK into a mobile app lets the product marketer access all of Yespo’s tools for retaining, engaging, supporting, and educating users.

We clearly understand that quicker integration means shorter sales cycles for your project. So we prepared simple step-by-step integration instructions for your app developers.
