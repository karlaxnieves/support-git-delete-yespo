A/B testing (or split testing) is a methodology for researching user experience. When running a test, you can split your audience to test different variations of your widget or launcher and determine which of them is performing better.

In Yespo, you can run an A/B test for the following types of widgets:

- Subscription forms
- Informers
- Launchers
- Age gate

A test can include different types of widgets.

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> You cannot delete the widgets participating in a running test.

You cannot run A/B tests for the widgets:

- Containing errors.
- Having non-saved changes.
- Used in another A/B test.

To open the A/B tests screen, go to _Site â†’ Widgets_ and select _A/B tests_ in the left-hand side panel. If you do not have any tests, the A/B tests landing page displays.

## Managing A/B Tests

To create a new A/B test, click the New test button.Â 

You need at least 2 widgets to create and run an A/B test. If you donâ€™t have them, pressing the _New widget_ button opens the dropdown menu suggesting the creation of a widget.

Select the type of widget you want to create and follow the instructions in [Setting Up Widgets for Your Site](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/setting-up-widgets-for-your-site).

      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


  When you have the widgets to compare, you can proceed with the creation of tests.

In Yespo, you can create and run A/B tests to compare:

- 2 widgets.
- 2 widgets when one has a connection to a launcher.
- 2 pairs of widgets and launchers.

See the following sections to learn how to create and run the different types of tests.

When you have the created and completed tests, the A/B tests page shows the tests in progress marked with the play icon in the Status column. The completed tests are marked with the _tick_ icon.

The Confidence column shows the reliability of the test results in percent. The test results are reliable when the confidence is greater than 90%. In this case, the confidence value is displayed in green.

### Stopping a Test in Progress

To stop the test in progress, expand the In progress dropdown menu in the Status column and select one of the options:

- **Stop**: To stop the test and keep the widgets published.
- **Stop and unpublish the worse**: To stop the test and unpublish the widget with the worst performance when the confidence is less than 90%.
- **Stop and unpublish loser**: To stop the test and unpublish the widget with the worst performance when the confidence is greater than 90%.
- **Stop and unpublish both**: To stop the test and unpublish both widgets when the confidence is 0%.

## Running the A/B Test for 2 Widgets with One Attached to the Launcher

If one of your widgets has the By click on launcher option enabled in the Widget calling settings, you can run an A/B test for 2 widgets attached to that launcher.

When the page visitor clicks the launcher during the test, it will show either widget A or widget B, depending on the traffic allocation values applied.

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> For this type of test, only one widget must have the By click on launcher option enabled.

To run an A/B test for 2 widgets attached to the same launcher:

1. In the left-hand side panel, select _A/B Tests_ and click the _New test_ button.

## Running the A/B Test for 2 Variations of a Widget Attached to 2 Variations of a Launcher

If both your widgets have the By click on launcher option enabled in the Widget calling settings, you can run an A/B test for 2 widgets attached to 2 different launchers.

The page visitor will see either of the launchers and their associated widgets depending on the traffic allocation values applied.

In this case, 2 different tests are run automatically:

- Test for launchers.
- Test for widgets.

The statistics data are collected independently for each test.

To run an A/B test for 2 variations of a widget attached to 2 variations of a launcher:

1. In the left-hand side panel, select _A/B tests_ and click the _New test_ button.
