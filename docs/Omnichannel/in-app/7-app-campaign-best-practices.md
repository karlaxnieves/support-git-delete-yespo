Join us as we delve into the world of In-App campaigns, uncovering insights and inspiration to help you craft your own successful strategies for engaging and delighting users within your mobile app ecosystem.

## 1. Push Notification Opt-In

**Scenario**

A user has been actively using your app for a week but hasn't enabled push notifications.

**Solution**

Create a [dynamic segment](https://docs.esputnik.com/docs/creating-dynamic-segment) with conditions that specify new users active for seven days who haven't enabled push notifications. Add this segment [to the In-App triggering rules](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/in-app-publishing-and-triggering-rules) and set the display frequency, e.g., once per week.

During the next session of such a user, an In-App message appears, highlighting the benefits of enabling mobile push notifications for timely updates and exclusive offers, encouraging the user to opt in for a more personalized experience.

    }

}

## 2. Feature Highlighting

**Scenario**

A first-time user is not aware of all the functionalities available in the app.

**Solution**

Create dynamic segments with conditions specifying user segments that haven't used different features. Add these segments to the triggering rules of In-Apps promoting these features.

With contextual messaging, your app guides such users through key features, facilitating a smooth onboarding and creating a new, savvy app fan ready to spend with you.

    }
  ]
}

## 3. Exclusive Discount

**Scenario**

A consumer just downloaded your app but hasn't made a purchase yet.

**Solution**

Create a dynamic segment with conditions that specify new consumers who haven't made a purchase yet. Add this segment to the In-App triggering rules and set the time in the app, after which the exclusive discount will be shown.

As the user scrolls through the app, a targeted In-App message offers an exclusive first-purchase discount to entice them to convert.

      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "40% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


## 4. Product Of The Day

**Scenario**

A user is presented with a vast array of products, and this abundance of choices makes it difficult for them to make a decision, leading to delayed purchases.

**Solution**

Create a dynamic segment with conditions that specify the target audience's product interests. Add this segment to the In-App triggering rules and set the display frequency, e.g., once per session.

Your app delivers a “product of the day” message generated based on the user's previous screen views or purchase history, overcoming the decision challenge and increasing the likelihood of a successful purchase.

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "40% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


## 5. Social Sharing

**Scenario**

A loyal user is unaware of your referral program, where they can be rewarded for inviting friends.

**Solution**

Create a dynamic segment with conditions that specify loyal users. Add this segment to the In-App triggering rules and set display frequency, e.g., only once.

A targeted In-App message introduces the referral feature and highlights rewards for inviting friends, motivating the subscriber to share their experience, and potentially increasing user acquisition.

    }
  ]
}

## 6. New Feature Announcement

**Scenario**

A subscriber uses the application a lot but has not engaged with a new key feature.

**Solution**

Create a dynamic segment with conditions that specify active users who haven’t used the key feature. Add this segment to the In-App triggering rules and set display frequency, e.g., once per week.

Your app delivers a notification explaining how the new feature enhances the In-App experience, ensuring ongoing engagement by keeping the offering relevant to the user's evolving needs.

      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "40% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


## 7. Trial Expiration Notification

**Scenario**

A user's trial is about to expire, and there has been no sign of renewal.

**Solution**

Create a dynamic segment with conditions that specify users who have started a trial but don’t sign up for renewal before its expiration. Add this segment to the In-App triggering rules and set display frequency, e.g., only once.

An In-App pop-up a few days before trial expiration offers easy renewal with a loyalty discount or bonus to directly influence the user's decision to continue, reducing churn and ensuring a steady revenue stream.
