There are two main ways to launch marketing campaigns: **by segments** (bulk) and **by events** (trigger). Bulk campaigns are great for Christmas newsletters, and triggered mobile pushes are essential for onboarding new users. However, In-App messages differ from emails and push notifications in terms of marketing and technical perspectives.

From a marketing standpoint, the concept of sending in-app messages is not accurate. It's more appropriate to view it as **running a continuous campaign** for a specific user segment. This continuous engagement is a key aspect of In-App campaigns.

From a technical perspective, the real-time delivery of In-App messages is of utmost importance. While a 40-second delay in sending push notifications or emails may not be a significant issue, even a 10-second delay in In-App messages can be detrimental to user experience.

Yespo's In-App messages approach fixes these issues. In-App setup and triggering rules **are configured directly in the message settings**. You can run a campaign for the segment and display it instantly through an on-device event.

Let's explore how to set up In-App triggering to meet various business goals.

## Setting Up In-App Campaigns

The preparation of In-App campaigns consists of two parts: [design of the appearance of messages](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/creating-in-app-message) and setting their triggering rules. Triggering rules contain

* selection of the event and its parameters that will trigger In-App,
* definition of target segments,
* display frequency settings.

The main settings options are events and segments.

### Triggering by Event

Select the event that will trigger In-App in its triggering rules, such as completing a lesson or a game level.

You can detail settings by specifying additional event parameters, such as completed **5th** lesson or **5th** level.

### Triggering by Segment

To address the In-App campaign to a certain segment, specify the appropriate segment in message-triggering rules. For example, you can incentivize the first purchase in the segment of users who use the app for a week but do not use paid functionality. To do this, [create the segment](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/how-add-dynamic-segment) with appropriate conditions and specify it in the triggering rules of the In-App with a special offer.

> Combining the *After event* and the *To whom* triggering rules is possible. For instance, limit the In-App triggering after a specific event to certain countries.

## Using In-App in Omnichannel Workflows

You can use the *Mobile Push* and the *Add to segment* blocks to trigger In-Apps within a workflow.

### Mobile Push

[Link an In-App to tap at a mobile push](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/linking-app-mobile-push), for example, to reveal more details about the offer contained in the push. Specify such a push in the *Mobile Push* block settings, and users will see both messages within the workflow.

### Add to Segment

1. Specify a static segment (*List*) into which users will fall in the *Add to segment* block settings.

Set the corresponding segment in the In-App triggering rules (*To whom*).

Adding a user to the segment in the workflow will trigger the In-App according to its triggering rules.
