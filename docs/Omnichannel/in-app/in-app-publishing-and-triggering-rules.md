After saving [the messageâ€™s appearance](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/creating-in-app-message), its additional settings page will open, where you can:

* Publish the In-App and schedule itâ€™s displaying
* Return to appearance edits
* Set triggering rules

> ðŸ“˜ Important
>
> [Install SDK](https://docs.yespo.io/reference/integrating-your-app-with-yespo#1-install-sdk-and-connect-communication-channels) to send In-Apps through Yespo.

Before publishing In-App messages, subscribe to a pricing plan.

> ðŸ“˜ Note
>
> * The number of contacts in a subscription is calculated based on *deviceId*.
> * If the number of contacts in an In-AppÂ channel exceeds the planâ€™s limit, messages will not be displayed to contacts above the limit.

## Publishing and Scheduling

Select the *Published* option from the list and save the changes to display the message to app users according to the rules below.

Select *Unpublished* to stop the message from displaying, then save your changes.

You can also specify the In-App display schedule by clicking the calendar icon.

The schedule includes the following options:

* Display start and end dates
* Custom dates and time
* Device timezone â€” if this option is selected, the display schedule will be applied according to the time zone set on the recipient's device; or you can select one of the timezones from the list

Message statuses are displayed in the general In-App list:

* Unpublished
* Scheduled â€” the publication period is planned for the future
* Expired â€” the publication period has expired

> ðŸ“˜ Note
>
> In-App can be sent only [through a tap on a mobile push message](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/linking-app-mobile-push) without setting triggering rules.Â  Configure triggering rules to display In-App messages as separate entities.

1. You can choose the following options in the *Display frequency* section:

* Do not limit (the message will be shown once after the session starts unless additional conditions are set)
* Only once (the message will be shown once during the appâ€™s life on the device)
* Once per session (session ends after 5 minutes of user inactivity; session duration is unlimited)
* One time per X minutes/hours/days/weeks (message will be shown every time after the specified period)
* X time, but no more than once per minute/hour/day/week (the message will be displayed the specified number of times after the specified time has expired)

2. You can choose the following options in the *When to display* section:Â 

* On app open
* When any condition is met:
  * Spent X seconds/minutes in app
  * After the event (select one from the list)

When you activate the *Show after event type* option, you can add one or more event parameters and their values to be checked (the parameter can contain, be equal to, or start with a value).
