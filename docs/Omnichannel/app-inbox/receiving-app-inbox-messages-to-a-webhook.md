Instead of sending API requests to our system to get App-inbox messages for your contacts, you can receive the list of all the available App-Inbox messages to your webhook.Â 

We can configure for you the maximum number of messages for your contacts. The default number is 1,000.

> ðŸ“˜ Note
>
> We can send the messages to your webhook only for the contacts having externalCustomerId assigned.

## Webhook Requirements

You have to send us the webhook URL, where you want to receive the messages, and the basic authorization (optional).

### App Inbox Message

The messages you receive have the following format:

```json
{
    "externalCustomerId" : string, 	// Receiver identifier
    "id" : UUID,                   		// Interaction ID. Used to set status
    "createdDate" : long,         	// Timestamp in milliseconds
    "title" : text,
    "content" : text,
    "image" : string,              		// URL
    "link" : string,                	// URL
    "category" : string,            	// Message category
    "customData" : string
