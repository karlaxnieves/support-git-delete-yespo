Communicate with subscribers of your Telegram bot using Yespo: give advice, inform, and sell goods or services. This mobile marketing channel is the most convenient and familiar to a large part of your audience. At the same time, Telegram messaging costs less than Viber and SMS.

Telegram tokens are associated with other contact information in Yespo, such as email and phone number, allowing you to include a Telegram bot in your omnichannel strategy.

Setting up Telegram mailings via Yespo should be done with the participation of your Telegram bot developer. If you don't have a chatbot, create one using the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://telegram.me/BotFather" target="_blank"> @BotFather</a> service.Â 

After integration, the marketer will be able to use Telegram in the same way as other Yespo channels:

- Create messages in the editor
- Send bulk campaigns
- Include Telegram messages in trigger workflows
- View campaign reports
