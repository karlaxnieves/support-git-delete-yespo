SMS is a simple tool for effective and brief customer communication. It is as smart and flexible as other Yespo communication channels. Ad its main advantage is speed and breadth of coverage: each subscriber will see important information from your company.

We provide two options for SMS messaging:

1. Using YespoÂ as a service provider (you need [to register an SMS sender ID](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/sms-sender-id));
2. Through your service provider [using processing in our system](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/setting-up-sms-processing).

> Use [purchase possibility segmentation](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/segmentation-web-tracking-events#3-predicted-event) when you want to reduce the cost of your messaging without losing the potential revenue it should generate. By leaving only the most likely buyers in the target segment, you will reduce the number of messages sent, but at the same time retain as many possible orders as possible.
