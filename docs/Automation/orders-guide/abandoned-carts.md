To set up and manage an abandoned cart workflow, you need to:

1. Create an abandoned cart email.
2. Create a segment.
3. Create a workflow.
4. Launch the workflow.
5. Test triggered emails.
6. View reports.

## 1. Create an Abandoned Cart Email

- Go to _Messages_ and click _Create email_. In _Basic_, select the template _Abandoned Cart_ and edit it as needed.

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


- Add to the product blocks basic variables (product image, name and price) so that the data on abandoned and recommended items can be automatically added to the email when itâ€™s generated personally for each contact. This data will be taken from the data source youâ€™ve previously uploaded to the system.

Read a [full guide on how to add dynamic variables to emails](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/introduction-to-velocity).

You can choose any other template from _Gallery_ or use your custom template and edit them as needed. This way, make sure you specify all the variables for the block with abandoned products and recommended products if you have it.

- Create a data source and assign it to the email. The abandoned cart template typically contains two blocks with products â€“ abandoned items and recommended items. You need to create different data sources for each of them.

If you have added your custom variables, make sure they also correspond to the parameters of the data source so that the content is added properly to the email.

Read a [full guideline on how to create a data source and assign it to the email](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/how-set-product-recommendations-email).

We recommend adding to your abandoned cart emails a corresponding tag (for example, cart). This will allow a faster search of emails and triggers and more convenient report assessment.

## 2. Create a Segment

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> To create segments based on product events and online store events, you need to [setting up web tracking](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/web-tracking-overview) in your account.

Before creating the workflow, you need to create a segment that will include all contacts who have added products to their cart but left without completing the purchase.

- Go to _Contacts â†’ Segments_, click _Add segment_ and choose _Dynamic_. Enter the name and optionally purpose and tags, and click _Next_.
- In _Include_, click _Add condition_ and select the following conditions: _Product events â†’ Abandoned browses â†’ All_. Change _last weeks_ to 24 _last hours_.

      ],

      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


## 3. Create a Workflow

- Go to _Automation â†’ Workflows_ and click _New workflow_. Create a workflow with the following blocks: _Start, Email, End_.

For the block _Email_, in _Message_, select the created abandoned cart email. In _Contact ID_, enter _${ContactId}_.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/2c978d0a65e0f44c52a0cd1c39c47671d632dc5104a6c272baf6d2859fea131f-setting-up-an-abandoned-cart-workflow-01.webp",
        "Settings for the block Email",
        "Settings for the block Email"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


## 4. Launch the Workflow

- Go to _Automation â†’ Workflows_, select the created abandoned cart workflow and click _Start/StopÂ configuration_.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/e9e6cdfe9de492a8deeb10dddffb6e0eb0428c0f912682fab42fe8def9ca52ae-abandoned-cart-201.webp",
        "Trigger configuration",
        "Trigger configuration"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


- Click _Regular_ and in _Segment_ select the created abandoned cart segment. Leave the default start date (that is the day of configuration).
- In _Start schedule_, select once an hour.
- In _Process unique events_, select _start no more than once in 7 days_. Click _Apply_.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/12c59687c29028a15fca41a2cd3a89b2e553b40e57214fa328414efbeb38f300-abandoned-cart-202.webp",
        "Schedule setings",
        "Schedule settings"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


> ðŸš§ Important
> 
> The condition _Once in every 7 days_ restricts sends to the same contact. Based on it, one contact can receive only one abandoned cart email per week. Such restriction helps minimize spam complaints and unsubscribes because people donâ€™t like receiving reminders after each site visit. However, you can specify any condition you like.

- Click _Activate_Â and confirm the action. The workflow status will change to active.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/9d2d0a9dc9ad6fe0e53cff1b6eb7a46cdbf92bf482dbe2d0a83ee0adb2ddb4d8-abandoned-cart-203.webp",
        "Confirm start",
        "Start button"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


Such configuration launches the workflow once an hour. After the launch, the segment is refreshed and new contacts are added to it.

## 5. Test Triggered Emails

- To test triggers for an abandoned cart, go to the corresponding website (which data sources youâ€™ve uploaded in the system), from the email or browser, sign in if needed, view products, add them to the cart, and leave without completing the purchase.
- To check whether the system tracked the triggered action, go to your personal profile â†’ _Settings â†’ Data sources_ and click the data source youâ€™ve assigned to the abandoned cart email.

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]

## 6. View Reports

To see reports on single emails (tests), go to _Campaigns â†’ Single reports_ and select the necessary email. Hover over the message title or click it to view a full version. Youâ€™ll be able to see what email was generated and what products were added to the blocks with variables.

[block:image]

      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/514c77764099ec50d1dcf378876a145fd155bbc4ec908353ff70e8db80ba4056-setting-up-abandoned-cart-workflow-007.webp",
        null,
        "Report on a single email"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


To see reports on campaigns sent from the workflow, go to _Campaigns â†’ Reports_ and click the necessary campaign.

[block:image]

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


Here, you can see statistics of campaign performance like opens, clicks, results by domain, etc. You wonâ€™t be able to see the generated blocks as each contact will receive their own version.
