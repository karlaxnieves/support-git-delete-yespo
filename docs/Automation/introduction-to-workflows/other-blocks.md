## Task

[More detailed information >](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/popular-blocks#task)

## Webhook

The task of this block is to request the specified URL (use only theÂ _HTTPS_Â protocol). Available request types areÂ _GET_Â andÂ _POST_. Data format:Â _JSON, XML, text_.

Use webhooks, when you need to access the data source by reference to return a promo code or authorization token, and then display this data in a message within a workflow. With this block, you can also transmit to the specified address:

- parameters from the event that launched the workflow,
- (additional) fields of the contact on which the workflow launched.

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> TheÂ _Webhook_Â block is used only in combination with the block for sending aÂ [single message](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/message-blocks)Â in any channel, and also with theÂ _Variable matches regular expression_Â block. For workflows where a message is sent to a group, theÂ _Webhook_Â block does not apply.

Read detailed instructions on setting up, testing, and managingÂ [webhooks in workflows](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/webhook-workflows).

## Sprayer

The block creates events for each contact of the selected segment.

As a rule, if the workflow is launched for a segment, you cannot add the blocks designed for contacts. Sprayer enables to do so.

It works as follows:

- The workflow for a segment has been launched (the segment ID was passed in the event, or the segment is selected in the Sprayer settings).
- The workflow reaches the blockÂ _Sprayer_.
- A separate event for each contact is created (transition from segments to contacts).
- This event launches a workflow for each contact.

The events created by the block contain an email address and contact ID. This makes it possible to launch a different workflow with these events and use contact blocks.

The block has 2 parameters:

- **Segment**: required parameter. Select the segment in the drop-down menu or specify ${segmentId} variable.
- **Event**: required parameter. Select the event you want to create.

When you select the segment in the block parameters, you can proceed to its preview and copy the ID.

      ],
      "align": "center",

    }
  ]
}
[/block]


Events must be created beforehand inÂ _Automation_Â â†’Â _Event types_.

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> Sprayer will trigger the event only if the segment includes less than 1 000 contacts.
> 
> All attempts to trigger the event for a bigger segment are displayed inÂ _Statistics_.
