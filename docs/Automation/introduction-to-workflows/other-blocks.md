## Webhook

The task of this block is to request the specified URL (use only theÂ *HTTPS*Â protocol). Available request types areÂ *GET*Â andÂ *POST*. Data format:Â *JSON, XML, text*.

Use webhooks, when you need to access the data source by reference to return a promo code or authorization token, and then display this data in a message within a workflow. With this block, you can also transmit to the specified address:

* parameters from the event that launched the workflow,
* (additional) fields of the contact on which the workflow launched.

> ðŸ“˜ Note
>
> TheÂ *Webhook*Â block is used only in combination with the block for sending aÂ [single message](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/message-blocks)Â in any channel, and also with theÂ *Variable matches regular expression*Â block. For workflows where a message is sent to a group, theÂ *Webhook*Â block does not apply.

Read detailed instructions on setting up, testing, and managingÂ [webhooks in workflows](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/webhook-workflows).

## Sprayer

The block creates events for each contact of the selected segment.

As a rule, if the workflow is launched for a segment, you cannot add the blocks designed for contacts. Sprayer enables to do so.

It works as follows:

* The workflow for a segment has been launched (the segment ID was passed in the event, or the segment is selected in the Sprayer settings).
* The workflow reaches the blockÂ *Sprayer*.
* A separate event for each contact is created (transition from segments to contacts).
* This event launches a workflow for each contact.

The events created by the block contain an email address and contact ID. This makes it possible to launch a different workflow with these events and use contact blocks.

The block has 2 parameters:

* **Segment**: required parameter. Select the segment in the drop-down menu or specify $\{segmentId} variable.
* **Event**: required parameter. Select the event you want to create.

When you select the segment in the block parameters, you can proceed to its preview and copy the ID.

Events must be created beforehand inÂ *Automation*Â â†’Â *Event types*.

> ðŸ“˜ Note
>
> Sprayer will trigger the event only if the segment includes less than 1 000 contacts.
>
> All attempts to trigger the event for a bigger segment are displayed inÂ *Statistics*.
