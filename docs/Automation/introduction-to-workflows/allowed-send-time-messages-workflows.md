Set the allowed time for sending messages from workflows, for example, from 10:00 am to 6:00 pm on weekdays.

If the trigger to send a message fires outside the allowed time, the system will send it as soon as the next allowed period begins.

> ðŸ“˜ Note
>
> * Checking the allowed time when sending single messages first occurs [according to the contact's time zone](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/how-import-and-match-contact-fields-in-the-system#time-zone); if it is not set, according to the time zone of the Yespo account.
> * Checking the allowed time for sending messages to segment occurs according to the time zone of the Yespo account.
