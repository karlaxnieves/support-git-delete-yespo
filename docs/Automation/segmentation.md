Segmentation is the process of dividing the contact database into segments based on specific conditions, such as gender, date of birth, order value, region, interests, etc.

Effective segmentation allows for more precise adaptation of marketing strategies, messages, and offers for each segment of contacts. It can also enhance the efficiency of campaigns and improve interaction with the audience.

## Segments Types

There are two types of segments in Yespo:

- **Lists**: static segments, that are updated manually, via workflows, or by transferring data [via API](https://docs.yespo.io/reference/getting-started-with-your-api). For example, when [importing contacts](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/uploading-file-with-user-profile-data), [exporting them from reports](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/exporting-subscriber-groups-reports) or dynamic segments.
- **Dynamic**: dynamic segments that are regularly updated according to specified conditions. As soon as a contact matches the specified conditions, itâ€™s automatically added to the segment. If the contact ceases to meet the conditions, it automatically leaves the segment.

## Creating Segments

1. Go to _Contacts â†’ Segments_ and click _Add segment_.

## Segment Management Options

To access management options, press the three dots icon in the segment field.

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


Available options:

- **Contacts export**

Any dynamic segment can be transformed into a regular contact list. For example, it is necessary to save contacts in a permanent list, as contacts in dynamic segments are constantly updated depending on conditions.

- **Copy segment**

Only for the _Dynamic_ segment type.

- **Split segment**

Used for A/B testing. Splitting can be done manually or automatically by activating the _Distribute evenly_ switch.

    }
  ]
}
[/block]


> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> You can split a segment only if it includes more than 10 contacts. We recommend conducting split tests with more than 2,000 active contacts to avoid inaccurate results.

- **Empty segment**

Only for the _List_ segment type.

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> When you delete contacts from the list, they will remain in your database.

## Deleting Segments

Two methods are available:

1. Via the segment management options.

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}

2. From the list of segments.

> ðŸ“˜ Note

> This method allows you to delete multiple segments at once.

Select the required segment from the list and click the _Delete selected_ button.

      ],
      "align": "center",

If you choose the _Delete with all contacts included in the segment_ option, restoring contacts will be impossible.
