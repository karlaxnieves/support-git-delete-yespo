In cases where subscribers select a specific subscription category, such as gender, age, city, or product preferences, you may need to set up the appropriate [welcome series](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/how-create-welcome-email-series).

Consider an example of setting up welcome series for male and female.

> üìò Important
> 
> Before creating a welcome series:
> 
> 1. [Set up a workflow](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/subscription-form-configuration#setting-up-the-workflows) for double opt-in.
> 2. Create a welcome workflow for each subscription form; then, when you make changes to one workflow, it will not affect the work of others.
> 3. Create welcome emails for different categories of subscribers:
> 
> - for male,
> - for female,
> - for contacts that did not specify gender.

## ¬†Setting Up a Workflow with Data Validation from the Gender Field

Use the workflow when passing subscriber data by the [Subscribe contact](https://docs.yespo.io/reference/subscribecontact-1) API resource. The system saves the data in additional fields and uses it for validation before running the workflow.

You can see additional fields in your account settings on the _Additional fields_ tab.

    }
  ]
}

Click on the _Personal Information_ heading to open a list of standard fields. The gender of the contact is stored in the additional _Gender_ field; in our case, it is ID 4. You can [recreate this field](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/how-add-additional-contact-fields) if you previously deleted it. Copy the field ID and its case-sensitive value to customize the workflow.

> ‚ùóÔ∏è Important

> When checking the additional field, the values ‚Äúm‚Äù and ‚ÄúM‚Äù (‚Äúf‚Äù and ‚ÄúF‚Äù) will be considered different. The value in the contact field must match the value in the workflow parameters.

### Workflow creation

1. Go to _Automation ‚Üí Workflows ‚Üí New workflow._

        "https://files.readme.io/bc2046c57202e7e7d2660cf1010968b64c171a76232e624794e396e21cab69b3-welcome-series-segmented-by-category-04.webp",

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


2. Put in the workflow‚Äôs name and add a [tag](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/how-add-tags) (optionally).

    {
      "image": [

        "",

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


3\. Add blocks _Start_ and _Task_; select the _[Confirm contact](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/popular-blocks#confirm-contact)_ task type. The welcome chain will start after the subscriber confirms their email in the Double Opt-in email.

        "https://files.readme.io/69b2468a67464b08f33919e05ba8f4f111dbc57c1bd84e10e1a0542af9cf20fe-welcome-series-segmented-by-category-06.webp",
        "",
        "Adding block Start  - \"Confirm contact\""
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


4. Add the block _Task ([Get contact](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/popular-blocks#get-contact))_ to get contact data.¬†

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/e7da5e61c11e0e6429698f88e5063d76b817b99002cab7b12978423ed6a70808-welcome-series-segmented-by-category-07.webp",
        "",
        "Adding block Start  - \"Get contact\""
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


5. Add Condition block and configure its settings:

- Select the task name _Variable matches regular expression_.
- In the _name_ field, indicate the _smartMessageJson_ system variable, in which information about a contact from the _Get contact_ block is transmitted.
- Indicate the¬†¬†_**.\*"4":"m".\***_¬† value in the pattern field, where _4_ is the gender field ID, and _m_ is a variable corresponding to the _male_ value; the system will check the contact data for compliance with this value.

  "images": [

        "https://files.readme.io/bf32f9d1c05bb955c242238d7c6a5f12e93262e9493a9b059e3cb7cf3d9bc381-welcome-series-segmented-by-category-08.webp",
        "",
        "Adding Condition block"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


6. For the next check of the additional field value, copy the _Condition_ block and indicate the regular expression¬† ¬†_**.\*"4": "f".\***_¬†¬† in the pattern field.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/9d06de6478086c5928a715b3dce454ecae571f38054fa7c3c3b36065a41b65f3-welcome-series-segmented-by-category-09.webp",
        "",
        "Adding Condition block"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


All contacts that do not meet the specified conditions (the value of the field is not equal to ‚Äúm‚Äù or ‚Äúf‚Äù) will follow the third branch of the workflow.

7. Add emails ([_Email_](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/message-blocks) block) and a delay in sending messages ([_Timer_](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/time-blocks#timer) block) to each branch, as when setting up a regular welcome series.

8\. Finish each branch with the [_End_](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/popular-blocks#end) block.

The welcome workflow for different subscribers‚Äô categories will look as follows:

        "",
        "Welcome workflow for different subscribers‚Äô categories"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
