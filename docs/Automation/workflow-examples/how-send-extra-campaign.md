Send extra campaigns based on the results of a previous campaign. Extra campaigns create in continuation to the sent or scheduled bulk and triggered campaigns and are available for all media channels:

* Email,
* SMS,
* Web Push,
* Mobile Push,
* Viber,
* App Inbox.

For example, the extra campaign allows you to contact in another media channel subscribers, to which delivery failed. Or resend notifications to contacts who read the message but didn't click.

One of the functionality features is that you can schedule sending the message for the dynamic segment from the campaign that hasnâ€™t been sent yet. At the moment of the extra campaign launch, the system will automatically create a segment based on the contactsâ€™ activity in the previous one.
