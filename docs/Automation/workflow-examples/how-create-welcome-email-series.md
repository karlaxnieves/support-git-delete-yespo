Customer data is often sent to our CDP using the [subscribe API method](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/api-methods-adding-contacts#subscribe-contact). In this case, the subscriber is added to the database as an unconfirmed contact. You can't send promotional emails to unsubscribed contacts without their permission to receive them from you.

To get the customer's permission, you need to ask them to validate their email address by sending a confirmation email through a [Double Opt-In](https://yespo.io/blog/why-do-we-need-double-opt-in) series. The next step is to send a welcome series.

The design of a welcome series will depend on your marketing goals.

In this article, weâ€™ll create a standard series consisting of two [welcome emails](https://yespo.io/blog/best-practices-welcome-emails). Since it is preceded by a double confirmation, thanking for the subscription is recommended in the first message. A discount or promotional code can also be a good start of the conversation. In the second message, you can tell more about the company and introduce the subscriber to other communication channels (social media, push notifications, YouTube, etc.).

## Step 1. Create welcome emails.
