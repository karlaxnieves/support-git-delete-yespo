Segment contacts that participated in the campaign according to its results: read, clicked on a particular link, unsubscribed, reported as spam, blacklisted, unconfirmed, etc. You can export each such segment to a CSV file or to a list in your Yespo account to continue working with contacts based on their reaction to the campaign.

## How to Export a Segment from a Report

Export of reports is available in the _Campaigns → Reports_ section.

Select the channel, campaign’s type (bulk/triggered) and specify the period for which you want to receive a report.

    }
  ]
}

b. By clicking on any segment built by the campaign’s results. For example, to export contacts who clicked on a specific link, go to the _Opens and clicks_ tab → _Table of clicks_ and click on the number of contacts who clicked on the link.

You can export contacts:

- To the CSV file.
- To the new list.
- To the existing lists.

### Export to CSV

Only users [with export rights](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/user-management) (Admin, Marketer) have the ability to upload contacts to a CSV file. 

After clicking on the _To CSV_ button, an email with a link to download the file will be sent to the address with which you log in to your Yespo account. The file will be available within 3 days.

### Export to the New List

Give the segment a name and click the New segment button, after which the created segment with the exported list of contacts will appear in the general segments’ list.
