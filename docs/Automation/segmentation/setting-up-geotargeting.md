Yespo lets you target users based on their location. The location is defined from their IP address.

Send personalized information to people from different regions. Bet on quality rather than on quantity.

Use ourÂ [dynamic segments](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/how-add-dynamic-segment)Â for geotargeted campaigns.

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> - Geotargeting is included in all plans exceptÂ _ADVANCED_.
> - Currently, `IPv4` addresses are supported.

## How Geo-tracking Works In Yespo

Yespo receives contact location data when

- A contact clicks a link in any marketing email message
- Web push message is delivered
- A contact uses a mobile application
- Our script sends the following widget-related events:
  - View
  - Click
  - Subscribe
  - SubmitÂ (for request forms)
- The contact is identified from the _webcontact_ [web tracking](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/web-tracking-overview) event; data about the language can be obtained from the headers of this event if the _Language_ field is empty in the card of such a contact.

Each time one of the above actions is performed, the contact's location data is updatedÂ (except the web tracking event, which does not update, but only records the relevant data if it is not in the contact card).

Also, you can [import](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/importing-historical-data) location user data to our system. The principle of its updating will be the same.
