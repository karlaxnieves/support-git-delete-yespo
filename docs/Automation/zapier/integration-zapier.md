Zapier is a service that allows you to connect different platforms and tools to automate data transfer and perform routine tasks. With Zapier, you can easily set up actions that happen automatically when certain events or conditions occur.

Here are some of the main benefits of using Zapier:

- **Improved productivity:** automation of routine tasks, such as sending emails or notifications via instant messengers; Zapier allows you to reduce manual work and focus on more important tasks.
- **Integration of programs and tools:** connecting platforms that do not have built-in integration tools; for example, you can create connections between your CRM systems, email, social networks, etc.
- **Marketing automation:** sending emails, nurturing leads, working with social networks, and other tasks to attract customers.
- **Improved communication:** notifications from the chat messaging service about important messages.
- **Analysis and reporting:** automate the collection and transfer of data to analytical tools for analysis and reporting.

## What is Zap

A Zap is a connection between one or more platforms consisting of 2 elements:

- **Trigger** — an event whose data needs to be transferred from platform 1 (for example, filling out a Google Form);
- **Action** — an action that must be performed on platform 2 (for example, creating a contact in Yespo).

> 📘 Note
> 
> Thanks to [dynamic segments](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/how-add-dynamic-segment), the _New Contact in Segment_ event becomes extremely multifunctional. For example, you can set up an alert if a new contact appears in dynamic segments of customers with an average bill of more than $1000.

List of actions in Yespo that can be performed after submitting a Zap:

- **Add/Update Contact** — adds confirmed contact or updates existing contact;
- **Send Email** — sends an email using a specified message template;
- **Send Event** — sends an event to user;
- **Send SMS** — sends SMS using a specified message template;
- **Subscribe Contact** — subscribes a contact.

- form name (_Form Name_ field).

      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


> 📘 Note
> 
> The form name appears in the event name that is sent to Yespo. For example, suppose you specify the **Test** form name in the Zap settings. In that case, when the contact fills out the form for the first time, the **subscribeFromApi-Test** event will be sent to Yespo, and when they fill it out again, **subscribeUpdateFromApi-Test** will be sent. You can connect [the double opt-in workflow](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/subscription-form-configuration) to the first event; the workflow for the second event can include a block to check if the contact has confirmed the subscription and other blocks depending on your tasks.
