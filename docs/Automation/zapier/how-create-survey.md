It is much cost-efficient to retain an existing client than to acquire a new one. That's why customer satisfaction is among the top priorities for all brands. And a survey is one of the ways to find how your customers feel about your product or service.

Automation of customer research is especially important for enterprise ecommerces with big customer bases. It helps run multi-stage surveys and quickly respond to changes in customer attitude and loyalty.

Through integration with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://stripo.email/" target="_blank">Stripo.email</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://zapier.com/" target="_blank">Zapier</a>, our CDP enables you to automate any customer research strategy, be it feedback on the shopping experience, a review of the bought product or a classic NPS (NetPromoter Score) survey.

## 1. Create a survey form.

Create a survey in the applicable communication channel. [Add tags](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/how-add-tags), for example, NPS or survey for convenient management within the system.

You can create a survey in two ways:

* Create a form on an external platform (for example, Google Forms) and [add a link](https://yespo.io/blog/how-create-survey-google-forms-and-add-it-email) to it to the email.
* Create a dynamic survey in our editor using a ready block with an [AMP form](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/how-create-amp-form). It will allow the user to take the survey straight in the email.

> üöß Important
>
> To send AMP content, you need to [register with Google as a dynamic sender](https://yespo.io/blog/how-apply-sending-amp-powered-emails-within-gmail).

If you need help, please contact to our support team, and our designers will help you create a survey form based on your corporate style.

To do this, you need to provide a list with questions and answer options. To simplify form filling, use skip logic for your survey. Offer users to answer questions based on the answers they've already given. For example, if the user answers ‚ÄúNo‚Äù to the question ‚ÄúDo you use Product A,‚Äù they won‚Äôt be shown questions about its price or technical characteristics due to their irrelevance.

## 2. Send the event to our platform

Set up a transfer of the [event](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/creating-events) that will trigger the workflow with a survey. Such an event can be sent from a CRM after an order confirmation call or after order confirmation on the website.

The event should transfer the parameters that will be used to identify the user and the order, for example:

* Contact email address;
* Phone number;
* Physical shop address;
* Call center manager‚Äôs SIP number, etc.

## 3. Create a workflow.

Go to Au*tomation ‚Üí Workflows* and click *New workflow*. [Create a workflow](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/workflow-management) and set the launch conditions.

You can create a basic workflow with a message block only.

<Image align="center" width="80% " src="https://files.readme.io/3d51d8e877a81d95ada7b7887273eb9fc01d084dc6011dc998c775b5a94bde25-building-a-customer-loyalty-survey-01.webp" />

You can create a more complex workflow with additional conditions. For example, if you send a survey and a follow-up reminder, you can [create a dynamic segment](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/how-add-dynamic-segment) that will include contacts who respond to the first survey request and fill the form in it.

For this segment, you may add the following conditions:

* Events ‚Üí Delivery ‚Üí Tag ‚Üí NPS;

<Image align="center" width="80% " src="https://files.readme.io/d4a2cd454551c542d5c9d5bb3dbd3acfaa4e328bbad24b67ec9fae9e5807db0f-building-customer-loyalty-survey-002.webp" />

* Delivery during 7 last days.

> üìò Note
>
> To use events as conditions for dynamic segments you need to subscribe to [Segmentation by Events](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/how-to-use-event-segmentation). To subscribe, please contact to our support team.

Build a workflow with the *Included in segment?* condition and select the created segment in the settings on the right.

When the survey form is filled, the zap will send to your account an event with the user's responses.

<Image align="center" width="80% " src="https://files.readme.io/f88738439919dcba65c41dfff588364809e76a81f7b50dd028f3d285f54efc79-building-customer-loyalty-survey-004.webp" />

## 5. Use responses.

### 5.1 Create a workflow based on user responses.

Create a workflow that will be triggered by the event sent to the system upon survey completion.

<Image align="center" width="80% " src="https://files.readme.io/ee2ff3ee682c7914b74c0eafeee6232d2df6657a3e4038f1cc5d379bc7971ad9-building-customer-loyalty-survey-005.webp" />

You can check the variable that corresponds to the answer that is of particular interest to you. For example, take the question "Did we help solve your problem?‚Äù the answer to which is transferred in the *Solved parameter*.

<Image align="center" width="80% " src="https://files.readme.io/190916707430417c1944c8ad903b3021000284fe7bff4ff5f5c42d85213651f2-building-a-customer-loyalty-survey-03.webp" />

If its value isn‚Äôt Yes, an extra workflow path will start for customers whose problem wasn‚Äôt solved. For example, you can send them an apology email with a bonus. Or you can email the responsible manager who can use the user's phone number and call center SIP number to find the right dialogue in the CRM and assess it.

### 5.2 Segment your contacts.

You can build communication strategies for each contact group by creating dynamic segments using segmentation by events. You can add different conditions based on the responses you receive.

<Image align="center" width="80% " src="https://files.readme.io/49c54b909c4f8a106b28390cd05e7b88523268472729b945eff26eaf18b20117-image4.webp" />

Regular surveys can help you identify growth points and weaknesses of your business. You may want to pay attention to product or service quality or review the bonus system for employees who contribute to customer loyalty. Our CDP helps automate your customer research and eventually improve customer satisfaction and retention.
