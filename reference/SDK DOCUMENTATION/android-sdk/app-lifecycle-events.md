Reteno SDK automatically can track application lifecycle and track events that described below.

## The AppLifecycle Category

1. `ApplicationInstalled` - event sent when application is launched the first time after installation.\
   Parameters:
   * `versionName` - application versionName
   * `build` - application versionCode or longVersionCode if api version >= 28
2. `ApplicationUpdated` - event sent when application is launched after the update. Update means that application versionName or versionCode has changed.\
   Parameters:
   * `versionName` - application versionName
   * `build` - application versionCode or longVersionCode if api version >= 28
   * `previousVersion` - application old versionName
   * `previousBuild` - application old versionCode or longVersionCode if api version >= 28
3. `ApplicationOpened` - event sent every time app goes foreground.\
   Parameters:
   * `wasBackgrounded` - true if application opened from background and false if application launched after it's been closed.
4. `ApplicationBackgrounded` - event sent every time app goes background. For android it means after ProcessLifecycleOwner OnStop would be received.\
   Parameters:
   * `applicationOpenedTime` - time at which app was opened
   * `secondsInForeground` - how much seconds user spent in the foreground

## The PushSubscription Category

1. `PushNotificationsSubscribed` - when notification permissions change it's state to true
2. `PushNotificationsUnsubscribed` - when notification permissions change it's state to false

## The Sessions Category

1. `SessionStarted` - when new user session is initialized.\
   Parameters:
   * `sessionID` - new autogenerated session identifier
   * `startTime` - session start time
2. `SessionEnded` - when user session ended.
   * `sessionID` - session identifier
   * `endTime` - session end time
   * `durationInSeconds` - duration of this session in seconds
   * `applicationOpenedCount` - how much times application was opened during this session
   * `applicationBackgroundedCount` - how much times application was backgrounded during this session

## Control or Disable  AppLifecycle Event Tracking

To control or disable tracking of some events you must supply instance of LifecycleTrackingOptions.

```kotlin
data class LifecycleTrackingOptions(
    val appLifecycleEnabled: Boolean = true,
    val pushSubscriptionEnabled: Boolean = true,
    val sessionEventsEnabled: Boolean = true
)
```

Also there are 2 useful shortcuts:

* `LifecycleTrackingOptions.ALL` to all categories
* `LifecycleTrackingOptions.NONE` to disable all categories.

There are 2 ways to let SDK know about LifecycleTrackingOptions:

1. ### During SDK Initialization

```kotlin
RetenoImpl(
        application = applicaiton,
        accessKey = "your_access_key",
        config = RetenoConfig(
            lifecycleTrackingOptions = LifecycleTrackingOptions(
                appLifecycleEnabled = true,
                pushSubscriptionEnabled = false,
                sessionEventsEnabled = false
            )
        )
)

```
```java
new RetenoImpl(
            /* application */ this,
            /* accessKey */ "your_access_key",
            /* config */ new RetenoConfig(
                /* isPausedInAppMessages */  false,
                /* userIdProvider */  createProvider(),
                /* lifecycleTrackingOptions */ new LifecycleTrackingOptions(
                    /* appLifecycleEnabled */ true,
                    /* pushSubscriptionEnabled */ false,
                    /* sessionEventsEnabled */ false
                )
            )
);

```

2. ### After SDK Initialization

```kotlin
reteno.setLifecycleEventConfig(LifecycleTrackingOptions.ALL)

```
```java
reteno.setLifecycleEventConfig(LifecycleTrackingOptions.Companion.getALL());
```
