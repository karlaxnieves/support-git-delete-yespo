## Overview

`Reteno` is a lightweight SDK for iOS that helps mobile teams integrate Reteno into their mobile apps. The server-side library makes it easy to call the `Reteno API`.

#### The SDK supports:

- Swift projects
- iOS 12.0 or later  
  â€‹

### Getting Started with Reteno SDK for iOS

Download and install SDK via **CocoaPods**.

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/ "{rel='nofollow'}") is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate Reteno into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'Reteno', '2.5.4'
```

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> If you are developing app modules, read the instructions on [installing the SDK via Swift Package Manager](https://docs.yespo.io/reference/ios#installing-the-sdk-via-swift-package-manager)

##### License

`Reteno iOS SDK` is released under the MIT license. See [LICENSE](https://github.com/reteno-com/reteno-mobile-ios-sdk/blob/main/LICENSE "{rel='nofollow'}") for details.

## Setting Up the SDK

Follow our setup guide to integrate the Reteno SDK with your app.

### Step 1: Add the Notification Service Extension

The `NotificationServiceExtension` allows your iOS application to receive rich notifications with images, design the buttons in notifications, and get message statuses (delivered, clicked).

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> If you already have Notification Service Extension in your app, follow Step 1.6.

**1.1**  In Xcode, _Select File_ â†’ _New_ â†’ _Target_...

**1.2**  Select _Notification Service Extension_ , then press _Next_.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/2758667-create_notification_service_extension.png",
        "create_notification_service_extension.png",
        "Notification Service Extension"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


**1.3**  Enter the product name as `NotificationServiceExtension` and press _Finish_.

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> Do not select _Activate_ on the dialog that is shown after selecting _Finish_.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/5b8118c-choose_options_for_extension.png",
        "choose_options_for_extension.png",
        "NotificationServiceExtension"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


**1.4**  Press _Cancel_ in the Activate scheme prompt.

By canceling, you keep Xcode debugging your app instead of the extension youâ€™ve just created.

If you activate the prompt by accident, you can switch back to debugging your app in Xcode (next to the Play button).

**1.5**  In the project navigator, select the project directory and select the `NotificationServiceExtension` target in the targets list.

Check that the Deployment Target is set to the same value as your Main Application Target.

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> iOS versions under 10 will not be able to get Rich Media.

        "configure_target.png",
        "Main Application Target"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


**1.6**  In the project navigator, select the `NotificationServiceExtension` folder and open the `NotificationService.swift`, then replace the entire file contents with the following code. Ignore any build errors at this point. We will import the Reteno module, which will resolve any errors.

```swift
import UserNotifications
import Reteno

class NotificationService: RetenoNotificationServiceExtension {}
```

This gives the ability to allow your iOS application to receive rich notifications with images.

### Step 2: Install the SDK via CocoaPods

**2.1**  If you don't have CocoaPods and the Podfile installed in your project, run the following script in Terminal:  
`sudo gem install cocoapods`

**2.2**  Run `pod init` from the terminal in your project directory.

**2.3**  Open the newly created `Podfile` with your code editor.

**2.4**  Add the `Reteno` dependency under your project name target and the  
`NotificationServiceExtension` target as below:

```swift
platform :ios, '14.0'

target 'RetenoExample' do
  use_frameworks!

  pod 'Reteno'
  
  target 'NotificationServiceExtension' do
    use_frameworks!

    pod 'Reteno'

  end

end
```

**2.5**  Run the following command in your terminal, in your project directory: `pod install`

**2.6**  Open the newly created `<project-name>.xcworkspace` file.

### Step 3: Import Reteno into Your App Delegate File

> ðŸ“˜ 
> 
> To setup SDK you need an `SDK_ACCESS_KEY`, visit [Managing Mobile SDK Access Keys](https://docs.yespo.io/reference/managing-mobile-sdk-access-keys) to get it.

#### Method 1: UIKit

In  [UIKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit), navigate to your AppDelegate file and add the `Reteno` initialization code to the `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method.  
Make sure to import the `Reteno` module `import Reteno`

```swift
import UIKit
import Reteno

@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
  
    func application(
        _ application: UIApplication,
        didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?
    ) -> Bool {
        // Reteno initialization
        Reteno.start(apiKey: "SDK_ACCESS_KEY")
      
        // Register for receiving push notifications
        // registerForRemoteNotifications will show the native iOS notification permission prompt
        // Provide UNAuthorizationOptions or use default
        Reteno.userNotificationService.registerForRemoteNotifications(with: [.sound, .alert, .badge], application: application)

        return true
    }
  
    // Remaining contents of your AppDelegate Class...
}
```

#### Method 2: SwiftUI

In SwiftUI, update your main 'APP_NAME'App.swift file and use the code below. Make sure to replace 'YOURAPP_NAME' with your app name.

```swift
import SwiftUI
import Reteno

class AppDelegate: NSObject, UIApplicationDelegate {

    func application(
        _ application: UIApplication,
        didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey : Any]? = nil
    ) -> Bool {
        // Reteno initialization
        Reteno.start(apiKey: "SDK_ACCESS_KEY")

        // Register for receiving push notifications
        // registerForRemoteNotifications will show the native iOS notification permission prompt
        // Provide UNAuthorizationOptions or use default
        Reteno.userNotificationService.registerForRemoteNotifications(with: [.sound, .alert, .badge], application: application)

        return true
    }

}
```

```swift
import SwiftUI
import Reteno

@main
struct YOURAPP_NAME: App {
    @UIApplicationDelegateAdaptor(AppDelegate.self) var appDelegate
    
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
    }
}
```

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> Starting from Reteno SDK 2.0.4 onwards, the `start` method was updated. In the previous version, it had the following parameters: `apiKey`, `isAutomaticScreenReportingEnabled`, `isDebugMode`, `isPausedInAppMessages`, `inAppMessagesPauseBehaviour`. In the new version, it now has the following parameters: `apiKey`, `configuration`. `RetenoConfiguration` is a struct containing the previous setups.

### Step 4: Set Up a Notification Permission Request

#### Option 1. Saving existing logic

If you have already configured subscribing for push notifications by yourself and don't want to change an existing logic, but have `Reteno` analytics features, call the `Reteno.userNotificationService.processRemoteNotificationResponse(_:)` SDK method right after you have received user response on the push notification. Pass a UNNotificationResponse as a parameter.

For example, you are using `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate` for processing incoming notifications and responding to notification actions. Call the SDK method like described below:

```swift
extension AppDelegate: UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate {
    
    func userNotificationCenter(
        _ center: UNUserNotificationCenter,
        willPresent notification: UNNotification,
        withCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping (UNNotificationPresentationOptions) -> Void
    ) {
        completionHandler([.sound, .badge, .alert])
    }
    
    func userNotificationCenter(
        _ center: UNUserNotificationCenter,
        didReceive response: UNNotificationResponse,
        withCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping () -> Void
    ) {
        Reteno.userNotificationService.processRemoteNotificationResponse(response)
        completionHandler()
    }
    
}
```

#### Option 2. Creating new logic

From Reteno SDK 1.5.4 onwards, method `registerForRemoteNotifications` has a closure with user response on notifications permission prompt and you can register for Remote notifications wherever you want. For example, you want to ask a user permissions for Remote notifications only after they have completed onboarding.

```swift
func onboardingCompleted() {
    Reteno.userNotificationService.registerForRemoteNotifications(with: [.sound, .alert, .badge]) { granted in
        // granted == true if user allowed receiving Remote notifications
    }
}
```

### Step 5: Add App Groups

App Groups allow additional interposes communication between the app and notification service and are necessary to provide access to Reteno storage data.

**5.1**  In your Main app target got to _"Signing & Capabilities"_ â†’ _"All"_

**5.2**  Click _"+ Capability"_ if you do not have App Groups in your app yet.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/67d7ac3-add_group_main_target.png",
        "add_group_main_target.png",
        "Capability"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


**5.3**  Select App Groups.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/fc76751-app_groups_capability.png",
        "app_groups_capability.png",
        "App Groups"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


**5.4**  Under App Groups, click the _"+"_ button.

**5.5**  Fill the _"App Groups"_ container with `group.{bundle_id}.reteno-local-storage`, where `bundle_id` is the same as _"Bundle Identifier"_ off your app (in the main target), then press `OK`.

**5.6**  In the `NotificationServiceExtension` target, repeat steps **5.2** - **5.5** for the extension target.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/69cfe0a-add_group_in_extension.png",
        "add_group_in_extension.png",
        "NotificationServiceExtension"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> The group name structure must be `group.{bundle_id}.reteno-local-storage`, where `bundle_id` is the same as your **Main App target** "Bundle Identifier". **Do Not Include** NotificationServiceExtension.

For more information, visit [Configuring App Groups](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/configuring-app-groups)

### Step 6: Provide Device Tokens to the SDK via the Following Method:

```swift
Reteno.userNotificationService.processRemoteNotificationsToken(_ deviceToken: String)
```

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> Providing device token depends on how you send push notifications: via **[Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)](https://docs.reteno.com/docs/connect-your-mobile-app#for-all-devices)** or directly to **[APNs](https://docs.reteno.com/docs/connect-your-mobile-app#only-for-ios-devices-apple)**

**Option 1.** If you send push notifications via **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** include a call to `Reteno` `processRemoteNotificationsToken:` in your `MessagingDelegate` delegate as follows:

```swift
extension AppDelegate: MessagingDelegate {
    
    func messaging(_ messaging: Messaging, didReceiveRegistrationToken fcmToken: String?) {
        guard let fcmToken = fcmToken else { return }
        
        Reteno.userNotificationService.processRemoteNotificationsToken(fcmToken)
    }
    
}
```

**Option 2**. In case sending push notifications directly to **APNs** include a call to `Reteno` in the AppDelegate method like in the example below:

```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: Data) {
        let tokenString = deviceToken.map { String(format: "%02.2hhx", $0) }.joined()
        Reteno.userNotificationService.processRemoteNotificationsToken(tokenString)
    }
```

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> Device token data should be converted to `String` as in the example. Don't send this token if you are using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).

### Step 7: Add Custom Behavior for Notifications

If you want to add custom behavior in the `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate` methods, provide your implementation in the appropriate closure:

```swift
Reteno.userNotificationService.willPresentNotificationHandler = { notification in
    // The closure will be called only if the application is in the foreground. 
    // You can choose to have the notification presented as a sound, badge, alert and/or in the notification list.
    // This decision should be based on whether the information in the notification is otherwise visible to the user.

    let authOptions: UNNotificationPresentationOptions
    if #available(iOS 14.0, *) {
        authOptions = [.badge, .sound, .banner]
    } else {
        authOptions = [.badge, .sound, .alert]
    }
    return authOptions
}
```

```swift
Reteno.userNotificationService.didReceiveNotificationResponseHandler = { notification in
    // Add your code here.
    // The closure will be called when the user responded to the notification by opening the application, 
    // dismissing the notification or choosing a UNNotificationAction.
}
```

Do it after configuring the Reteno SDK.

### Step 8: Run Your App and Send Yourself a Notification

Run your app on a physical iOS device to make sure it builds correctly. You should be prompted to subscribe to push notifications. Send test notifications not from the Firebase but directly from the Yespo. [More on sending test messages from the event debug view >](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/sending-test-messages-from-the-event-debug-view)

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> The iOS Simulator does not support receiving remote push notifications.

Also, we recommend using [Debug Mode](https://docs.yespo.io/reference/ios-debug-mode) to detect possible errors and inaccuracies within your Analytics implementation and events' logging.

## Installing the SDK via Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/ "{rel='nofollow'}") is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler.  
â€‹  
Once you have your Swift package set up, adding Reteno as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/reteno-com/reteno-mobile-ios-sdk.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "2.5.4"))
]
```

**Installation process:**

**1.** Go to the project settings and select `Package Dependencies`:

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/54bd62b-package_dependencies.png",
        "add_package.png",
        "Package Dependencies"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


**2.** Press "**+**" to add a new package to the project. In the opened window enter in a search field `reteno-ios-sdk` or paste a full URL `https://github.com/reteno-com/reteno-mobile-ios-sdk.git`. Select found package and fill required settings (dependency rule and project you are adding package).

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/dca0783-search_for_package.png",
        "search_for_package.png",
        "reteno-ios-sdk"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


**3.** Add the `Reteno` package to the main target

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/da80795-connect_package_1.png",
        "connect_package (1).png",
        "Add the `Reteno` package"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


and don't forget to add it to the `NotificationServiceExtension`.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/3dcb3c3-connect_package_to_extension.png",
        "connect_package_to_extension.png",
        "NotificationServiceExtension"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "80% "
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
