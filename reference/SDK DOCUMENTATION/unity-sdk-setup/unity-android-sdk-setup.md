## Setting up SDK

Follow our setup guide to integrate the Reteno SDK with your app.

1. From the Unity Editor, navigate to `Edit` > `Project Settings` > `Player` and click the `Android` settings tab.
2. Expand `Publishing Settings` and enable:

- Custom Main Gradle Template
- Custom Gradle Properties Template

3. Navigate to `Assets` > `External Dependency Manager` > `Android Resolver` > `Force Resolve` and resolve your Android dependencies.

It is done, most of the Android setup was already handled during installation!

If you want to ask a permission without using RetenoSDK function, you can do it. But after receiving a permission result, you have to notify RetenoSDK that status of permission might have changed. To do this, you have to call `UpdatePushPermissionStatus` function from RetenoSDK:

```C#
RetenoSDK.UpdatePushPermissionStatus();
```
